<h2>PUSS IN BOOTS, JR., AND<br />THE GOOD GRAY HORSE</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE MAGIC WINGS</h2>


<div class='cap'>ONE morning as little Puss, Junior, on his
Good Gray Horse rode through Mother
Goose country he saw a spider sitting in her tiny
lace house. She kept very still, for the early
dewdrops still clung to the delicate web. And
as the sun shone down they looked for all the
world like diamonds on a piece of lace. So little
Puss, Junior, stretched out his paw and, would
you believe it, instead of a drop of water he
picked off a real diamond.</div>

<p>"Ha, ha!" cried the little black spider. "The
witch's feather in your hat has changed the dewdrop
into a diamond. But I have no use for
precious stones, so you may have it. The
flies that come to my net are more to my liking."
And then she tied the strings of her little black
bonnet and put on her black silk mitts and
waited for a fly to make a call.</p>

<p>Well, after putting the diamond in his pocket,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Puss rode away, and by and by, after a while
he came to a steep hill. And, oh, dear me! it
was a dreadfully steep hill, for Puss had missed
his way and there was no path or road for him to
follow. And while he waited, not knowing what
to do, he heard a little voice say:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If I bring four wings to you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To fasten on your horse's shoe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Will you give me for my locket</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The sparkling diamond in your pocket?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"How do I know my Good Gray Horse can
fly with these wings?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"He may try them first," said the voice, and
out from behind a stump jumped a little dwarf,
dressed in green, with a red turban on his head.
Quick as a wink he fastened a wing to each foot
of the Good Gray Horse. And then he clicked
his tongue against his teeth and away went the
Good Gray Horse up in the air like a great bird.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" shouted the dwarf. "Don't forget
to give me the diamond," and he held out his
little hat for Puss to drop it in as the Good Gray
Horse sailed away on his winged feet over the
mountain.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as he crossed the top of the
great high mountain he came down to earth and,
strange to say, as soon as he touched the ground
the wings on his feet changed into long, silky
hairs, and, but for these, he was just the same
as he was before meeting the dwarf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="359" height="450" alt="Puss on a Horse" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Come, little master, since I have lost my
wings, to yonder inn. I am hungry for oats."
So Puss rode forward and, after leaving him in the
stable, sat down in the inn and waited for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
dinner. Pretty soon a little bird settled on the
window sill and sang:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"From my snug little nest in the old apple tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All covered with blossoms so fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I never have seen, though I'm over thirteen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A horse that could fly thro' the air."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Just then the innkeeper's wife came in, and
when she saw the little bird on the window sill
close to Puss, Junior, she cried, "Time for little
birds to be in their nests." So the little bird flew
away, and as soon as Puss had eaten his dinner
he again mounted his Good Gray Horse. After
a while he met an old man and a little dog.
The little dog was carrying a basket in his mouth
and the little old man a big pipe, from which the
smoke curled up in the shape of a bird. All of
a sudden he gave a puff and, would you believe
it, a glossy gray pigeon flew away.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the smoke again curled up from
the pipe into the form of a pigeon, and then, just
as before, the little old man gave a puff, and
away flew a pigeon, only this time it was grayish
blue.</p>

<p>I don't know how long this would have gone
on if the little old man had not suddenly turned
around.</p>

<p>"You have a wonderful pipe," said little Puss,
Junior. "I've never seen one like it."</p>

<p>"There are lots of strange things in Mother
Goose Land," answered the little old man. "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
you are a traveler, as I think you are, you will
meet with many strange adventures."</p>

<p>Then with a bow he turned in at the gate of a
little pink-and-blue cottage, at the rear of which
stood a pigeon house on top of a tall pole. As
Puss turned around for a last look, again the
smoke from the little old man's pipe changed
into a pigeon, which flew straight toward the
little pigeon house.</p>

<p>Well, after that Puss rode along for some time,
and by and by the moon came out and dimly
lighted the road, which now led through a forest.
It was very quiet, except for the tooting of an
owl or the cry of a tree toad.</p>

<p>Little Puss commenced to whistle when, all of
a sudden, the Good Gray Horse jumped to the
side of the road, and there, right in front of him,
stood a tiny fairy, dressed in green. "Halt,
Sir Cat!" he cried, waving his silver wand.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE HOLD-UP</h2>

<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
"OH, who is so merry, so merry, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">As the light-hearted fairy, heigh ho, heigh ho!"</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>As soon as the little fairy I mentioned in the
last story finished his song Puss, Junior's, Good
Gray Horse stood up on his hind legs, for he
wasn't used to these little people of the forest,
you see.</p>

<p>"Whoa, my good steed," cried Puss. "Don't
you see it's only a little fairy?"</p>

<p>"Only a little fairy!" cried the forest fay.
"I would have you understand, Sir Cat, that I
have at my command a million subjects. I have
but to sound a call upon my silver horn and they
will surround you."</p>

<p>"Bah!" cried Puss, scornfully. "I have no
fear of such tiny things."</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! no sooner had he said this
than the fairy blew a shrill blast upon his silver
horn, and from all directions came thousands
of little fairies on moth millers and fireflies.
And, oh, dear me! again, before Puss knew what
was going to happen they stretched tiny ropes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
about his Good Gray Horse and bound his legs
fast, and after that they tied Puss to the
saddle.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the little fairy. "Now,
my good Sir Cat, will you believe that fairies
have power?"</p>

<p>"Gid-ap!" cried Puss, but his good gray steed
could move neither head nor foot. "Gid-ap!"
he cried again; but his Good Gray Horse could
move neither ears nor tail.</p>

<p>"Gracious me!" exclaimed Puss. "I'm in a
pretty mess!" And then the fairies began to
sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Pride must ever have a fall.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ne'er despise the weak and small.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Only he who's brave and good</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall pass safely through this wood."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I don't see how that applies to me," cried
Puss, stoutly. "I may have been a trifle rude,
but I maintain I'm brave and good."</p>

<p>Well, just then, all of a sudden, a big kind-hearted
owl flew down from his nest in a tree
and cut all the fairy ropes with a big pair of
scissors. And then he gave a great hoot, which
so frightened the fairies that they flew away,
helter skelter, into the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to me," said Puss.
"How shall I repay you?"</p>

<p>"Forget it," said the owl, taking off his gold-rimmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
spectacles and wiping his left eye with a
yellow silk handkerchief. "If you would get
safely out of this forest,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Follow the path, the moon is still bright.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Take the first turn&mdash;the one to the right.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Willow Tree Inn you'll find in due course,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where you'll find shelter for you and your horse."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Thank you," said Puss. "If your directions
are as good as your rhyme I shall have no trouble
in finding the place."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<h2>WILLOW TREE INN</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE moonlight shone brightly on the sign of
the Willow Tree Inn as Puss reached up for
the big brass knocker. But he wasn't tall
enough, so he stood on an empty flower pot and
rapped twice on the door.</div>

<p>"Who's there?" asked the innkeeper, poking
his head out of the window.</p>

<p>"Puss in Boots, Junior."</p>

<p>"Very well, Master Boots," said the innkeeper.
"Rest on the porch till I put on my
boots." And pretty soon the door opened and the
sleepy innkeeper appeared with a lighted candle
in his hand. "Ah, you have a horse," he said.
"Come, I will show you the way to the stable."</p>

<p>"Bad luck," cried the innkeeper, as a gust of
wind blew out the candle. "The moon is behind
a cloud. 'Tis dark. Can you make your way?"</p>

<p>"Never fear," replied Puss. "A cat can see
in the dark."</p>

<p>But, goodness me! just as they reached the
barn a bat knocked off Puss, Junior's, hat.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Bat, bat, come under my hat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I'll give you a slice of bacon,</span><br />
And when I bake I'll give you a cake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I am not mistaken,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>cried the innkeeper.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/gs04.png" width="388" height="500" alt="Puss knocking at the door" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"That sounds mighty good to me," said Puss,
Junior. "I've had no supper yet, and it's nearly
morning."</p>

<p>"So it is," answered the innkeeper. "Well,
we'll give your Good Gray Horse a mess of oats
and some hay. After that we'll go back to the
inn and cook a slice of bacon."</p>

<p>"And when you bake please give me a cake,
or I'll be much disappointed," cried Puss.</p>

<p>"I'd rather give it to you than to that old
bat," said the innkeeper, closing the stable door
and pushing in the bolt. "Of course, he catches
lots of mice, but at the same time I don't like
him."</p>

<p>"So you like me better?" said Puss.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll wait and see," said the innkeeper.
"In the meantime, come in." And he opened
the door and led Puss into the kitchen.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE ROBBER FAIRIES</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"COCKS crow in the morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">To tell us to rise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And he who lies late</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Will never be wise;</span><br />
<br />
"For early to bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And early to rise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is the way to be healthy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And wealthy and wise."</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Well, I haven't been to bed at all," said
Puss. "I was held up in the forest."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the innkeeper. "I had
no idea there were robbers about."</p>

<p>"There were no robbers, my good host," said
Puss. "You would hardly believe me if I were
to relate what actually happened."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said the innkeeper, "while I fry
the bacon."</p>

<p>So Puss explained how the fairies had made
him captive, although he feared that the good
man would doubt the truth of the story. But,
instead, the innkeeper said:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 391px;">
<img src="images/gs05.png" width="391" height="500" alt="Puss and the Innkeeper" title="" />
</div>

<p>"'Tis not the first time, my good Sir Cat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that I have heard of travelers being held up in
yonder woods by the fairies. Indeed, they take
a mischievous pleasure in waylaying us mortals
after sundown."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Puss. "Hereafter I shall take
great pains to avoid the forest after dark. I had
a narrow escape."</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon the innkeeper placed the food
upon the table and he and Puss sat down to eat.
But, oh, dear me! they had hardly commenced
when they heard a great commotion in the barnyard.
Puss rushed to the door just in time to see
his Good Gray Horse gallop out of the stable
yard with more than a hundred fairies on his
back, who drove sharp little thorns into his sides
and blew tiny horns in his ears.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" screamed Puss, rushing out-of-doors.
The Good Gray Horse, terrified by the cries of
the fairies as well as excited by the stings and
blows, paid no attention to the voice of his small
master, but dashed out upon the highway, and
in a few minutes disappeared down the hill.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" cried Puss, in dismay.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<h2>BICYCLE PUSS</h2>


<div class='cap'>"IF I had a horse in the stable I'd lend him to
you," said the kind-hearted innkeeper.</div>

<p>"Have you an automobile?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied the innkeeper. "But I
have a bicycle which I will lend you."</p>

<p>It took Puss but a moment to mount, and then
off he went to catch his Good Gray Horse, who,
you remember in the last story, had been stolen
by the fairies.</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! although it was early morning
it seemed as if everybody was up and out for
a walk. First, an old rooster stood right in the
middle of the road and crowed:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Cock-a-doodle do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your horse has lost a shoe."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Where is it?" asked Puss, stopping as quickly
as he could, while the good-natured rooster
hopped into the long grass and picked it up.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Puss, hanging the shoe
over his handlebar and setting off once more.</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! again, he had gone but a short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
distance when a curly-tailed pig got right in his
way, and of course Puss had to slow up.</p>

<p>"If you're looking for a runaway horse, you'd
better take the lane to your right," said the pig,
with a grunt and a twist of his curly tail.</p>

<p>So Puss set off again. But, oh, dear me! for the
third time, just in front of him was a big, fat
cow who had to walk very carefully not to touch
the fence rails on either side of her. Puss rang
his bell, but she paid no attention to him whatever.
She kept right on, swinging her tail from
side to side to brush off the flies. And maybe
Puss never would have passed her if she hadn't
all of a sudden, with a loud moo, trotted into a
meadow spread over with butter-cups.</p>

<p>Well, after a little way, Puss almost ran into
a big load of hay, and if the farmer had kept on
going down the road instead of turning into a
gate, I guess Puss would have never caught
up with his Good Gray Horse.</p>

<p>"Gracious me!" said Puss, when the road was
clear, "I must make up for lost time." But
just then a big black crow, who was sitting on a
fence post, called out:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Where are you going so fast, Sir Cat?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Look out, or the wind will blow off your hat."</span><br />
</div>

<p>And he flew off the fence and settled on the
handlebar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry! You'll get him, all right,"
said the crow when Puss told him what a hard
time he was having to overtake his Good Gray
Horse. "I saw him go by a few minutes ago.
He looked pretty tired." And then the old black
bird flew away to tell Mrs. Crow that he had
seen a pussy cat in boots riding a bicycle.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<h2>PUSS RECOVERS HIS STEED</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE girl in the lane, that couldn't speak plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cried, "Gobble, gobble, gobble!"</span><br />
The man on the hill, that couldn't stand still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went hobble, hobble, hobble!</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Goodness me!" exclaimed Puss, Junior, as he
mounted the bicycle which the kind owner of the
Willow Tree Inn had lent him, "I can't understand
a word the girl says. I asked her if she
had seen my Good Gray Horse and she answers,
'Gobble, gobble, gobble!'" And then little Puss
gave a great sigh, for it's pretty hard luck to have
your horse stolen while asleep in a strange inn,
although it's mighty lucky to have the innkeeper
lend you his bicycle.</p>

<p>Well, after a while and many a mile, the road
began to wind up a hill, so Puss got off and pushed
his wheel ahead until by and by he met a little
old man. He held a stick in both hands, on
which he leaned as he hobbled along.</p>

<p>"Did you see a runaway horse?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"I did, indeed, my good Sir Cat," answered the
hobble-hobble man. "He went by but a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
minutes ago. There were fairies on his back. I
thought at first I must be dreaming, till I remembered
once before in my life seeing a swarm
of fairies, if I might use the word, from yonder
forest in hot pursuit for a bold robber who had
waylaid a traveler."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/gs06.png" width="353" height="450" alt="The Hobble-Hobble Man" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Thank you," said Puss. "I must catch up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with them, for the horse belongs to me, and this
bicycle is a poor substitute."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think as much," replied the
hobble-hobble man. "But how are you going
to catch him? Those forest fairies are mischievous,
and you will need to pedal fast and
furious to overtake them."</p>

<p>"Never fear," replied Puss, stoutly. "I have a
good pair of legs." And, jumping on his bicycle, he
went up the hill at a great rate. On reaching the
top he was delighted to see his Good Gray
Horse going down the road to the valley.</p>

<p>"Here's where I overtake them," cried Puss,
placing his feet on the coasters. "My bicycle
can go downhill faster than a horse. In a few
moments I'll again be astride my faithful steed."</p>

<p>The dust flew out in a cloud behind him as he
swiftly coasted down the steep road. Ting-a-ling,
ting-a-ling! went his bell as he came nearer
and nearer. "Gid-ap!" cried the fairies, but the
Good Gray Horse was tired. He had gone
many miles at a gallop.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" cried Puss.</p>

<p>"Gid-ap!" cried the fairies.</p>

<p>But Puss was now close to them. Standing up
on the bicycle seat, he made a wonderful jump
and landed squarely on the saddle of his Good
Gray Horse. And then, with a scream of dismay,
the fairies flew away.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>GEORGY PORGY</h2>


<div class='cap'>NOW let me see. In the last story Puss had
taken his Good Gray Horse away from the
fairies, but didn't know what to do with the
bicycle which he had borrowed from the owner
of the Willow Tree Inn! "I can't very well ride
it and lead my horse," said Puss to himself,
"nor can I very well ride my horse and lead the
bicycle. What shall I do?"</div>

<p>A short distance off stood a small red schoolhouse
and just then through the open door came
a merry crowd of children. All of a sudden a
little boy with a piece of plum pudding in one
hand and a piece of pie in the other ran swiftly
toward Puss.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Georgy Porgy, pudding and pie,<br />
Kissed the girls and made them cry.<br />
When the boys came out to play<br />
Georgy Porgy ran away<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And after him came a number of boys in hot
pursuit. "Please help me get away from these
boys!" cried Georgy Porgy.</div>

<p>"What have you done?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Oh, I kissed the girls and made them cry,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
answered Georgy Porgy, "but it didn't hurt
them."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Kisses don't hurt," replied Georgy Porgy.</p>

<p>"But if these boys ever catch me"&mdash;looking
fearfully over his shoulder&mdash;"they'll give me an
awful beating and take away my pie."</p>

<p>"Do you know where the Willow Tree Inn
is?" asked Puss, all of a sudden.</p>

<p>"Yes, siree&mdash;," answered Georgy.</p>

<p>"Quick!" cried Puss. "Get on this bicycle and
take it to the innkeeper. He lent it to me."</p>

<p>But, oh, dear me! the boys were now close at
hand and Georgy Porgy had only time enough to
give Puss the pie and pudding. "Take 'em,"
he said, "I sha'n't have time to eat 'em. I
can't eat and ride at the same time!"</p>

<p>"Go it!" shouted Puss, and, goodness me!
how that bicycle did go!</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" yelled the boys.</p>

<p>"Go it!" screamed Puss. "Don't let them
catch you!"</p>

<p>And Georgy Porgy didn't! No, siree! Then
all of a sudden the recess bell rang, and of course
the boys had to turn back.</p>

<p>"I think I'll be jogging along, too," said Puss
to himself. "They might throw a stone at me
for helping Georgy." And he galloped past the
schoolhouse and was soon out of sight.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2>A JOLLY GALLOP</h2>


<div class='cap'>"WELL, well, well!" cried Puss, Junior, to
himself, as he pulled in his Good Gray
Horse after leaving the little red schoolhouse far
behind. "It was lucky for me that Georgy
Porgy happened to come my way. Otherwise,
how would I have been able to return the bicycle
to the innkeeper?" And after that he walked
his horse until he came to a stream, on the banks
of which stood an old mill. The mill pond was
rimmed with overhanging willow trees, and the
water trickled over the dam with a soft, gurgling
noise. Through the sluiceway the water ran in
a swift stream, turning the old wheel around and
around.</div>

<p>Puss dismounted, and after his horse had taken
a drink he cropped the fresh green grass, while
Puss lay down in the shade.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Margaret wrote a letter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sealed it with her finger,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Threw it in the dam</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For the dusty miller.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dusty was his coat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Dusty was the siller,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dusty was the kiss</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From the dusty miller.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If I had my pockets</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Full of gold and siller,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I would give it all</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To my dusty miller."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/gs07.png" width="355" height="450" alt="Puss and the pretty girl" title="" />
</div>

<p>Goodness me! Puss must have fallen asleep
in the shade of the old willow tree. It was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sleepy place, and the water trickling over the dam
made one dream of silver fishes! Puss rubbed his
eyes and listened:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If I had my pockets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Full of gold and siller,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I would give it all</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To my dusty miller."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Would you really?" asked Puss, looking up
at a pretty girl leaning against a tree close by.
It was she who had sung this little song, you see.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me! I thought I was all alone," she
sighed.</p>

<p>"So did I," said Puss, "until you woke me."</p>

<p>"Were you asleep?" asked the pretty girl.</p>

<p>"Asleep and dreaming," answered our small
hero.</p>

<p>"So was I&mdash;I mean I was dreaming," said the
pretty girl, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yonder stands my Good Gray Horse. Would
you like to ride with me?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied the girl, quickly. "Take
me for a jolly gallop." And the next minute she
and Puss, Junior, were racing down the road.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE RUNAWAY</h2>

<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
"MERRY are the bells, and merry would they ring;<br />
Merry was myself, and merry could I sing;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a merry ding-dong, happy, gay, and free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a merry sing-song, happy let us be.</span><br />
<br />
"Merry have we met, and merry have we been,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Merry let us part, and merry meet again;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With our merry sing-song, happy, gay, and free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a merry ding-dong, happy let us be."</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Whoa!" cried Puss, Junior, pulling in his
Good Gray Horse.</p>

<p>"You've given me a lovely ride," said the
pretty girl. "It is more than a mile from the mill.
I live just over there," pointing to a cottage on
the hillside.</p>

<p>"Shall I take you up to the gate?" asked Puss.
"No, I'll get off here, thank you," she replied,
"and I shall never forget how nice you've been.
I was quite unhappy before you spoke to me at
the old mill pond."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Merry have we met, and merry have we been,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Merry let us part, and merry meet again,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Puss, stretching out his paw.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"How well you remember my song!" said the
pretty girl, waving her hand to Puss as he rode
away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;">
<img src="images/gs08.png" width="328" height="400" alt="Horse and wagon" title="" />
</div>

<p>He had gone but a short distance when he heard
the clatter of hoofs. Looking back, he was
startled to see a horse and wagon come tearing
down the road.</p>

<p>"A runaway!" he exclaimed, quickly drawing
to one side. In a few minutes the frightened
horse rushed by. In the wagon was a little old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
man, clinging tightly to the reins and with great
difficulty keeping his horse in the middle of the
road. In an instant Puss set off in pursuit.
Pretty soon his Good Gray Horse drew close to
the wagon. "Don't give up!" cried Puss.
"Hold on tight!" The little old man did his
best, but by this time his horse had become
unmanageable and, turning suddenly to the
right, dashed up a steep bank. With a snap, the
harness broke and away went the frightened
animal.</p>

<p>"Let the pesky brute go," exclaimed the old
man. "He'll get tired of running and come
home by and by."</p>

<p>"You may have my horse," cried Puss. And
in a few minutes the harness was mended and
Puss and the little old man drove off down the
road.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<h2>HUMPTY-BUMPTY</h2>


<div class='cap'>HUMPTY-BUMPTY, bump! went the
wagon, as the Good Gray Horse trotted
along. "Very poor springs on this wagon,"
cried Puss, his teeth knocking together as they
crossed a rough bit of road.</div>

<p>"You are not used to farm wagons, my good
Sir Cat," the little old man replied.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Puss.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the conundrum in rhyme
about</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Thirty white horses upon a red hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now they tramp, now they champ,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now they all stand still'?"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>asked the little old man.</div>

<p>"No," replied Puss. "But who ever saw a red
hill?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the little old man, showing
how very few teeth he had to chatter. "Why,
the thirty white horses are your teeth, and the
red hill is your gums. Ha, ha!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"He, he!" laughed Puss. "Gid-ap, my Good
Gray Horse. Let us rattle the thirty white
horses upon a red hill, let them tramp and champ,
but never stand still!" And away went the
wagon clattering after the Gray Horse, bumpty-bumpty,
bump!</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried the little old man. "If I
have but few teeth, I have old bones! Do you
wish to shake me to bits?"</p>

<p>"Whoa!" cried Puss, but the Good Gray
Horse evidently thought it great fun, for on he
went at a still faster clip. The boards in the
bottom of the wagon flew up and down and the
wooden seat swayed back and forth. Up and
down, bumpty-bumpty, bump! went the little old
man.</p>

<p>"Pull him in!" he cried. "Pull on the lines!
Don't let your horse run away!"</p>

<p>Puss tugged at the reins, but the Good Gray
Horse had the bit between his teeth. He stuck
out his head and tail and let his feet fly. Over
the stones bumped the wagon, up on one side
and then down on the other. Poor Puss had all
he could do to keep from falling out, and the
little old man clung to the side boards and cried,
"Pull on the lines!"</p>

<p>"I am," panted Puss, "but it doesn't do any
good."</p>

<p>"Pull harder!" yelled the little old man.</p>

<p>"Can't," replied Puss, now breathless from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
bumping of the wagon. "Can't pull one little
bit harder."</p>

<p>"Turn him in yonder lane!" screamed the little
old man. "That's my lane! It leads into the
barnyard."</p>

<p>Well, it was mighty lucky that Puss managed
to turn up the lane, and in another moment they
were racing into the yard, but before Puss could
stop him the Good Gray Horse went head first
into the haymow and headlong over the dashboard
went Puss and the little old man.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE HAYMOW</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was a mighty lucky thing that the Good
Gray Horse in the last story ran into the haymow
instead of the corncrib. Well, as soon as
Puss picked himself up the Good Gray Horse
pulled his head out of the haymow. He had
gone in quite deep, for he was going at a great
rate, and it's a wonder he didn't go right through
the great mound of hay.</div>

<p>"Whew! Miew!" cried Puss, pulling wisps of
hay out of his hair and dusting off the tops of his
red boots. "That was a pretty sudden stop!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it turned out all right," said the little
old man. "It was about the best way to stop
your horse, methinks. It was lucky there was
hay in the way, I should say."</p>

<p>"How could you be such a bad old thing?"
asked Puss, stroking the Good Gray Horse on the
nose. "The idea of your running away with us!"</p>

<p>The Good Gray Horse made no reply, however.
He looked a little foolish, but, beyond
that, he seemed very much the same, except that
his collar was pushed up over his ears and his
harness twisted about his neck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, put him in the stable," said the little
old man. "We'll give him a good bed and some
oats. My own horse may show up some time
this evening&mdash;that is, if he ever gets tired of
running."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/gs09.png" width="367" height="475" alt="Into the Hay Mow" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Good Gray Horse was made comfortable
the little old man led Puss, Junior, into
the house.</p>

<p>"Mother," he called out, as he opened the door,
"here is a visitor for you."</p>

<p>A queer little old woman arose from her
rocking chair and came forward. "What! a
cat!" she exclaimed, throwing up her hands in
dismay. "John, you know I don't like cats!"</p>

<p>"Then, madam," said Puss, Junior, politely,
"I'll not trespass on your hospitality," and he
turned to leave.</p>

<p>"Not so, not so!" cried the little old man.
"Mother, you don't understand what has happened.
This noble cat has done me a good turn.
My old mare ran away and he kindly hitched up
his Good Gray Horse to my wagon and brought
me home."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the little old man's wife, "that's
another story. This cat is no ordinary cat.
Let him make himself comfortable while I go
and see about supper."</p>

<p>But Puss still hesitated.</p>

<p>"You are indeed welcome," said the little old
woman, peering over her glasses to get a good
look at him; "you shall stay and rest yourself,
for you have helped my good man, and whoever
does my man a good turn shall never go
unrewarded."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAUFFEUR TAFFY</h2>


<div class='cap'>"HIGH-HO, how the winds blow!" exclaimed
little Puss, Junior, as he rode along on his
Good Gray Horse toward the castle of my Lord
Carabas to see his dear father, Puss in Boots.</div>

<p>But New Mother Goose Land is a big country
and Puss did not realize how long a journey it
was. You see, he had been seeking adventures
for so long and had traveled so far&mdash;sometimes on
the back of his good friend, Goosey Goosey
Gander, sometimes in the airship whose captain
was a downy goose and the sailors four and
twenty doves, and then, again, on broomsticks
and umbrellas and baskets that flew in the air
with their old women owners&mdash;that now, once
more astride of his Good Gray Horse who had
carried him many a mile in Old Mother Goose
Land he felt he would soon be with his father.</p>

<p>Well, as Puss rode along he came to a bend in
the road where an automobile stood. It had
evidently broken down, for the chauffeur was
tinkering with the machinery.</p>

<p>All of a sudden a blackbird perched herself on
the fence along the road and began to sing:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"Taffy was a chauffeur, Taffy was a loafer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Taffy broke a tire everywhere he went.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His master soon grew tired, Taffy he was fired;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Taffy he was fired without another cent.</span><br />

"Taffy came to master's house; master wasn't in.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Everyone but Taffy ran away in fright."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Whoa there!" cried Puss, Junior, and the
blackbird must have thought it was meant for
her, for she stopped her song and looked at our
small hero. And of course the Good Gray
Horse stopped, and Taffy&mdash;well, he crawled
out from under the automobile and scowled at
the blackbird. And this made Puss, Junior,
laugh, and the Good Gray Horse cough and the
blackbird snicker, all of which made Taffy very
red in the face.</p>

<p>"Tell-tale-tit, your tongue shall be slit," he
cried, but the blackbird clapped her wings and
flew away. And after that Puss, Junior, said
gid-ap to his horse and rode off, leaving Taffy
to finish mending his automobile. And after a
little while the blackbird came back and settled
herself on the head of the Good Gray Horse.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she said.</p>

<p>"To visit my father, Puss in Boots," replied
our little hero.</p>

<h2>THREE LITTLE KITTENS</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THREE little kittens lost their mittens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they began to cry,</span><br />
"Oh, mother dear, we very much fear<br />
That we have lost our mittens."<br />
</div></div>


<p>"I'll help you find them," cried Puss, Junior,
looking in through the door of a little green
house.</p>

<p>"Will you?" said a little tabby cat.</p>

<p>"I think we lost them by the woodpile," said
a little gray kitten.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we dropped them while playing
hide and go seek," said a cute black kitty.</p>

<p>"Come on, my little pussyfoots," cried Puss,
Junior, with a grin. "I'm pretty good at finding
things&mdash;except people&mdash;I can't find my dear
father."</p>

<p>"How did you lose him?" asked the first little
kitty, as they all ran out into the back yard.</p>

<p>"I don't know any more than you know how
you lost your mittens," replied Puss, Junior,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"If you find our mittens we'll help you find
your father," cried the three little kittens. But,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hunt as they might, no mittens were to be found.
Under the woodpile and back of the old well,
behind the woodshed and under the grape arbor,
they hunted, but in vain.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/gs10.png" width="367" height="475" alt="Puss and Mittens" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"You naughty kittens! Lost your mittens!
Then you shall have no pie!"</p>

<p>"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow."</p>

<p>"No, you shall have no pie."</p>

<p>"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow."</p>

<p>"Have you looked in the barn?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"No," cried the three little kittens.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a good place to look if you've
been playing there," suggested Puss. So they all
ran out to the barn. But just as they entered
the big door a little mouse scurried into a hole
and a big gray rat ran into the corn bin.</p>

<p>"Look here, little mouse, if you'll tell us whether
you've seen any mittens we won't hurt you," cried
Puss. But the little mouse didn't reply.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Rat," said Puss, Junior, speaking
into a crack of the corn bin, "if you'll tell us
whether you have seen any mittens we'll promise
not to touch you." But the rat didn't answer.</p>

<p>"They're afraid of you," said the little black
kitty.</p>

<p>"Then you ask them," whispered Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"Did you see our mittens?" whispered the
black kitty to the little mouse.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied a squeaky voice. "I saw some
mittens in the tool closet." Then the little black
kitty ran over to the tool closet, and pretty soon
he came dancing out on his two hind legs.
"Here they are! Here they are!" he cried, with a
happy purr.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<h2>MR. RAT</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE three little kittens found their mittens,<br />
And they began to cry,<br />
"Oh, mother dear, see here, see here!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">See, we have found our mittens."</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Thank you," said the black kitty, as the
little mouse peeped out of her house, "thank
you very much for telling us where our mittens
were."</p>

<p>"We promise never to hurt you," cried the
three little kittens.</p>

<p>Puss, Junior, walked over to the corn bin.
"Look here, Mr. Rat," he said, in a gruff voice,
"as long as you were so mean not to tell us where
the mittens were, I won't promise not to catch
you."</p>

<p>"You'd better wait till you get the chance,"
replied the rat, looking down from the top of the
bin.</p>

<p>"Just wait till we grow up, Mr. Rat," said
the three little kittens, looking very fierce with
their whiskers standing out straight from their
little fat cheeks and their tails twice their
natural size. "You had better not be too sure
of yourself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"For many a rat who has spoken like that<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Has been caught when he least was aware.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So you'd better look out what you are about,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For we are three kittens who dare."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"That's the way to talk to him," said Puss,
Junior, admiringly. "We'll scare him to death,
anyway."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said the rat. "You don't
know who I am. I'm the rat 'that ate the malt
that lay in the house that Jack built.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are, are you?" said Puss. "Well,
what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Making a visit," replied the rat.</p>

<p>"Look out," advised Puss, "or you may not
find it a pleasant one."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied the rat with a loud
laugh. "Who's afraid of three little kittens?
They can't even find their mittens." Before
he had time to say another word Puss, Junior,
sprang on top of the corn bin. Away went the
rat, over the barn floor, out through the open
door, down the path to the road. Puss, Junior,
kicked off his red-topped boots and went after
him.</p>

<p>"Go it, Puss, dear!" screamed three little
kittens. "Catch him!"</p>

<p>The ground was covered with a light fall of
snow, but this made no difference to Puss,
Junior. He was a big, strong, healthy cat, and
he didn't mind running barefoot in the snow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
This was not the case with Mr. Rat, however.
Very soon his feet became so cold that he could
hardly run, and before he reached the gate Puss
pounced upon him.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Puss, fiercely, holding him
down on the frozen ground&mdash;"look here, Mr. Rat,
we don't want you around here any longer. Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"I'll promise to go back to Jack's house if
you'll let me up."</p>

<p>"All right," said Puss. "Now go!" And
away went the frightened rat.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>A BIG TUMBLE</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"PUT on your mittens, you silly kittens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">And you shall have some pie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r."</span><br />
"Oh, let us have the pie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r."</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>Mrs. Cat stood in the doorway of her little
house and again she called out, "Put on
your mittens, you silly kittens."</p>

<p>"And I'll pull on my boots," said Puss,
Junior, running back to the barn. "My toes
are almost frozen."</p>

<p>"Has the horrid old rat really gone?" asked the
three little kittens.</p>

<p>"He has," replied Puss. "Didn't you see me
catch him just before he reached the gate?"</p>

<p>"There was so much snow flying about that
we couldn't see very well," said the gray kitten.</p>

<p>"Well, I caught him, all right," replied Puss,
pulling on his boots, "but he begged me so hard
to let him go that I did. He promised he'd never
come back."</p>

<p>"If he really is the 'rat that ate the malt that
lay in the house that Jack built' I don't believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Jack will be very glad to see him," said the little
tabby cat, pulling on her mittens.</p>

<p>"My paws are almost frozen," cried the little
gray kitten. "I'm so glad we have found our
mittens."</p>

<p>"Good-by, mousie," cried the little black
kitten, going up to the mouse hole and peeping
in. "We all thank you very much for telling us
where our mittens were. We're going into the
house now, for mother has some pie for us.
We'll bring you out a little piece of crust in a
few minutes."</p>

<p>"Don't forget!" she answered, peeping out of
her hole. "Bring us three pieces, for I have two
little children who are very fond of pie crust."</p>

<p>"You be sure to save a little piece of crust,"
said the black kitty to the tabby kit, "and you,
too," he said, turning to the gray kitten; "then
we'll have three pieces!"</p>

<p>"Let's close the barn door," said Puss, before
they started off for the house. "The little mouse
may freeze if we leave it open."</p>

<p>It was a very big barn door that ran on little
iron wheels, and it wasn't easy to move. "Push!"
cried Puss, bracing his feet against the side of the
barn.</p>

<p>"We can't push any harder," cried the three
little kittens.</p>

<p>"Try again," said Puss. "Now, all together,
heave ho, heave ho!" The big door began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
move. "Push!" cried Puss. "It's beginning to
move."</p>

<p>The three little kittens did their best, and
pretty soon the little wheels went round and
round, faster and faster, until all of a sudden the
big door bumped into the other end of the doorway,
sending Puss, Junior, and the three little
kittens head over heels into the snow.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2>HUNGRY KITTENS</h2>


<div class='cap'>"GOODNESS, what a bump!" cried the
little black kitty, wiping the snow from
his eyes.</div>

<p>"Gracious! what a bump!" said Puss, scrambling
up from the ground. "I think I felt it
more than the old barn door, for I was underneath,
you see, and you were piled on top of
me."</p>

<p>The three little kittens felt very sorry and
commenced to brush the snowflakes from his
fur coat. "There's snow in your boot legs,"
said the little gray kitten, standing on tiptoe
and looking down Puss, Junior's, boots. "Don't
you feel it? I should think it would make you
shiver."</p>

<p>"I'll soon find out," said Puss, pulling them
off and turning them upside down.</p>

<p>"Are they wet inside?" asked the tabby kitten,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not very," said Puss, squinting up one eye
and peering in.</p>

<p>"If they are," said the little black kitten,
"mother will dry them for you at the fire."</p>

<p>Then:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
The three little kittens put on their mittens,<br />
And soon ate up the pie.<br />
"Oh, mother dear, we greatly fear<br />
That we have soiled our mittens."<br />
</div>

<p>While Puss was busy placing his boots before
the kitchen stove the three little kittens seated
themselves at the table.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/gs11.png" width="269" height="350" alt="Puss shaking out his boot" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Why don't you take off your mittens?" Puss
asked. "I guess you're so hungry you can't
wait," he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>It took but a short time for his boots to dry,
for there was a big, blazing fire in the stove.</p>

<p>"Don't you want something to eat?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Mrs. Cat, coming over to Puss. "You have
very pretty boots," she continued, lifting up one
and looking at it with much admiration.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are nice boots," said Puss, Junior.
"They were made for my famous father, Puss in
Boots. Mr. Solomon Grundy, who was born on
a Monday, made them years ago for my father.
And one day, it was only last week, when I
stopped at his store, I saw a notice in his window
that he had died on Saturday and was buried
on Sunday, and that was the end of Solomon
Grundy."</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Mrs. Cat.</p>

<p>"When I went into the store," continued Puss,
"Mrs. Grundy took them down from a shelf
and sold them to me. Then she went across the
street to ask an old friend where my father lived,
but she couldn't find out&mdash;her friend didn't know
or couldn't remember&mdash;so here I am, still searching
for my daddy."</p>

<p>"Too bad," said Mrs. Cat again. "I'm really
very sorry. But do not give up hope, for you
will find him I am sure."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<h2>KITTENS WASH MITTENS</h2>


<div class='cap'>AFTER Mrs. Cat had powdered Puss, Junior's,
toes so that they would slip easily into his
boots she turned to see what the three little
kittens were doing. They had just finished eating
the pie. She had been so interested in hearing
how Puss, Junior, had found his red-top
boots that she hadn't heard them say:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Oh, mother dear, we greatly fear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That we have soiled our mittens."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Mrs. Cat. "Soiled your
mittens, you naughty kittens!"</p>

<div class='poem'>
Then they began to sigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mi-ow, mi-ow, mi-ow."</span><br />
Then they began to sigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mi-ow, mi-ow, mi-ow."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Take them off at once," cried Mrs. Cat.</p>

<p>"We will, mother," said the three little kittens.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine why you kept them on," said
Mrs. Cat.</p>

<p>"We were so hungry we didn't have time to
take them off," said the little black kitten.</p>

<p>"My fingers were so cold I thought I'd leave
them on," cried the tabby kitten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't think about anything," sobbed the
little gray kitten. "I just looked at the pie, and
then I forgot I had on mittens."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 334px;">
<img src="images/gs12.png" width="334" height="400" alt="Mrs. Cat" title="" />
</div>

<p>Mrs. Cat stood with her front paws on her
hips, looking first from one little kitten to
another.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything like children?" she
sighed, turning to Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"My dear madam, forgive them this once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
They were so excited over finding the pie that
they lost their heads."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing they are tied on," said
Mrs. Cat, with a laugh; "they might not be
found as easily as the mittens."</p>

<p>The three little kittens looked very much
ashamed. Then the little black kitten ran over
to the washtubs and, jumping on a stool, turned
the hot-water faucet. His mother handed him a
big cake of soap, and in another minute the
other two little kittens climbed up beside him.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" asked Mrs.
Cat, with a sly wink at Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"Never mind, mother, dear. Please don't
look." And they commenced to scrub their
mittens. And when they had them all covered
with lather they dipped them into the water and
squeezed them until the soapsuds looked like a
snow drift, and after that they all reached down
and pulled out the stopper, and when the soapy
water was all gone they filled the tub again
with nice, clean water and washed the mittens
all over again. But, oh, dear me! the water was
so deep that the little gray kitten wet her little
pink sleeve.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<h2>PIE FOR MRS. MOUSE</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE three little kittens washed their mittens<br />
And hung them up to dry.<br />
"Oh, mother dear, do you not hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That we have washed our mittens?"</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>Sure enough, all the mittens were washed and
neatly hung on the clothesline. But the clothesline
was so high that Puss had been forced to
climb a stepladder. The kittens had stood below,
their little paws full of clothespins, and
every time Puss needed a pin one of them had
climbed up and handed it to him.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Washed your mittens! Oh, you're good kittens.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But I smell a rat close by.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hush! Hush! mee-ow, mee-ow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We smell a rat close by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>cried Mrs. Cat.</div>

<p>When Puss heard this he ran around the house.
I guess he expected to find the "rat that ate the
malt that lay in the house that Jack built."
But Mrs. Cat had made a mistake, for there was
no rat to be seen. Instead, there stood the little
mouse who two or three stories ago had told the
black kitty where to find their mittens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Puss, Junior,
kindly.</p>

<p>"I think the three little kittens have forgotten
their promise to give me three pieces of pie.
I've been waiting in the barn all this time."</p>

<p>"Kittens!" cried Puss.</p>

<p>The three little kittens came tumbling around
the house. But the little mouse ran behind a tree.</p>

<p>"Did you forget to save some pie crust for the
little mouse and her two children?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" replied the three kittens.</p>

<p>"I tucked a little piece under my plate," said
the gray kitten.</p>

<p>"I put a little piece in the old clock," said the
tabby kitten.</p>

<p>"And I put mine behind the big shell on the
mantelpiece," cried the black kitty.</p>

<p>"Go and get them," said Puss, "for Mrs.
Mouse can't be kept waiting; her babies out in
the barn will be crying for her."</p>

<p>The three little kittens ran into the house, and
pretty soon returned with the pie crust.</p>

<p>"We'll carry it out to the barn for you," they
cried.</p>

<p>So the little mouse ran ahead, and when she
was safe in the barn she waited until the kittens
had placed the three little pieces of pie crust on
the floor. As soon as they had gone the little
mouse came out and carried the pie crust into
her house.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<h2>SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
SING a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sing'">song</ins> of sixpence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pocketful of rye,</span><br />
Four and twenty blackbirds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Baked in a pie.</span><br />
<br />
When the pie was opened<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The birds began to sing.</span><br />
Wasn't that a dainty dish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To set before the king?</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>Well, when little Puss, Junior, heard those
blackbirds singing he halted before the castle
and knocked on the gate.</p>

<p>"You must have a thousand canaries."</p>

<p>"Canaries nothing," replied the old retainer.
"The King's twenty-four blackbirds are singing."</p>

<p>But, goodness, gracious me! all of a sudden
something happened. And it was even worse
than when the raven cried, "Croak!" and the
farmer's mare fell down and broke her knee.
For just then, while</p>

<div class='poem'>
The maid was in the garden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hanging out the clothes,</span><br />
Down came a blackbird<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And snapped off her nose.</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 387px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps he was angry because he hadn't been
invited to sing for the King. I'm sure I don't
know, but, anyway, he was a mighty mean bird,
let me tell you.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried the poor maid,
and she sat down on a garden bench and began
to weep. Just then the four and twenty blackbirds
jumped out of the pie and flew into the garden
to look for that naughty bird. But they
couldn't find him. Oh, dear, no! He was far
away by that time, maybe at the North Pole of
Mother Goose Land, which they tell me is a
frosted stick of sugar candy.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do?" sobbed the maid, still
holding her poor nose in her hands.</p>

<p>"You had better call in the doctor," suggested
Puss.</p>

<p>"He lives a good two miles from here," said the
old retainer, "and our telephone is out of order."</p>

<p>"I'll go fetch him," said Puss. "Dry your
eyes, pretty maid!" And, jumping on his Good
Gray Horse, he galloped away. And the four
and twenty blackbirds flew after him so that in
case the naughty blackbird came back to nip
little Puss, Junior's, nose they would be there to
protect him.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<h2>DOCTOR FOSTER</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
DOCTOR FOSTER went to Glo'ster<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a shower of rain;</span><br />
He stepped in a puddle up to his middle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never went there again.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>Which was a mighty lucky thing, for, goodness
knows, perhaps the poor maid never would have
had her nose mended if Puss hadn't found the
good doctor at home.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as he learned what was the matter,
he jumped up behind Puss, and the Good
Gray Horse kicked out his heels and galloped
away, and the four and twenty blackbirds trailed
after them, and pretty soon, not so very long,
they came to the Blackbird-pie Castle. There sat
the poor maid in the garden, still holding her nose
in her hand.</p>

<p>"Let's see it," said the doctor, opening his
little black bag and taking out medicine and
bandages.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's half gone," sobbed the maid,
"I don't want to look at it."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 394px;">
<img src="images/gs14.png" width="394" height="500" alt="Dr. Foster binding up the Maid&#39;s nose" title="" />
</div>

<p>"But I do," said the doctor. "Otherwise,
how can I mend it?" And I guess he was right,
for he was the most famous doctor in all Mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Goose Land. Well, as soon as she took away
her hand he said:</p>

<p>"It's not as bad as it might be. It still looks
like a nose!"</p>

<p>"Does it?" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the doctor, turning to Puss and
the old retainer. "You'll hardly know the
blackbird touched it after I get through."</p>

<p>"Maybe he only pinched it," said Puss.</p>

<p>"Or only tweaked it," said the old retainer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he thought it was a cherry," laughed
the doctor, putting on some powder.</p>

<p>And then the maid began to smile. "It feels
much better already," she said.</p>

<p>"Well it's always a good thing to call in the
doctor," said the learned man. "You never can
tell what may happen," and, picking up his little
black bag, he held out his hand. "Two shillings,
please!"</p>

<p>"Mercy me!" she cried. "I haven't had my
wages for this month."</p>

<p>"What did you do with last month's?" asked
the doctor, but before she could reply one of
the four and twenty blackbirds dropped a gold
piece in his hand. I guess he felt dreadfully
ashamed to think that one of his brothers had
pinched a pretty girl's nose.</p>

<h2>A MISCOUNT</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE King was in his counting-house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Counting out his money;</span><br />
The Queen was in the parlor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eating bread and honey.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>And now let us see where little Puss, Junior,
was. Oh yes, I remember now. He was in the
garden of the Blackbird-pie Castle, where the
poor maid's nose had been nipped by a naughty,
bad blackbird. Well, after the good Doctor had
gone, the old retainer took Puss to see the King,
who was so busy counting his money that he
didn't even look up.</p>

<p>"Your Worship," began the retainer.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the King, angrily.
"I've just counted up to three trillion two hundred
and thirty-seven billion, nine hundred and forty-eight
million, seven hundred and fifteen thousand,
four hundred and&mdash;and&mdash;now you've gone
and made me miss, and I'll have to count all
over again."</p>

<p>"Start off at four hundred. A few sovereigns
less won't matter to a king," said little Puss,
Junior.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," replied His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Majesty, taking off his crown and scratching his
head. "One likes to be right as well as King!"</p>

<p>"Nobody said, my lord!" cried the old retainer.
"But consider your health. Let's take
this wise cat's suggestion and quit for the time
being."</p>

<p>"All right," said the King. "Let's go find the
Queen."</p>

<p>She was in the parlor eating bread and honey.
"How do you do, my dear Puss, Junior?" she
cried.</p>

<p>"I am very well, thank Your Majesty," he
replied.</p>

<p>"I have just heard what valuable assistance
you have rendered our court," continued the
Queen.</p>

<p>Puss would have blushed had not his cheeks
been covered with whiskers.</p>

<p>"I did but do my duty, Your Majesty," he
replied.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"Did you not hear, my lord?" cried the
Queen. "Our maid had her nose bitten by a
naughty blackbird, and our little friend here
quickly fetched the Doctor, bringing him on his
Good Gray Horse in short time."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed His Majesty. "I will
reward him. He shall have a castle and a
retinue."</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness," exclaimed Puss,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Junior, "I am overwhelmed with your generosity,
but I needs must decline your offer. For until
I find my father, the famous Puss in Boots, I
may not rest upon my journey except for sleep
and refreshment."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 314px;">
<img src="images/gs15.png" width="314" height="400" alt="Puss kissing the Queen&#39;s hand" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Zounds!" exclaimed the King. "You are a
gallant cat. Would that all my subjects were as
faithful to their duty as you are! But," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
added, with a smile, "you shall rest here for the
night, for a good dinner and a sound sleep will
make you travel the faster on the morrow."</p>

<p>The Queen by this time had finished her bread
and honey.</p>

<p>"Come out on the terrace," she suggested, "for
it is cool and pleasant there, and the flowers are
very beautiful. I would show Sir Cat our
flower garden."</p>

<p>The King, therefore, gave his arm to the Queen
and Puss gallantly held up her train, the three
walking slowly out upon the broad terrace. The
sun was quite low in the sky, for it was late in
the afternoon. The big hills to the westward
seemed to hold up the sky, and Puss wondered
whether the jolly old sun would not bump himself
as he slid down over the edge of the world.</p>

<p>"Come, Puss dear, take my hand," said the
Queen. She then went over and sat down on a
marble bench. Picking up Puss, she held him in
her arms and commenced to sing, and presently
he fell fast asleep. The Queen looked up at the
King and said, "Is he not a dear little cat?" and
the King for answer took from his purse several
gold pieces and tucked them away in Puss,
Junior's, pocket.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<h2>PLUM PUDDING STORY</h2>


<div class='cap'>WHEN Puss, Junior, awoke from his nap
he was surprised to find himself in the
Queen's lap. It was growing dark and for a
moment he wondered where he was. "Don't
ask where you are, my dear Puss," laughed the
Queen, "for you are safe and well."</div>

<p>"Your Majesty," said Puss, rubbing his eyes,
"I was also very comfortable. Pardon me for
dropping off to sleep in your presence."</p>

<p>Just then a page appeared and announced that
dinner was served. The King arose and offered
his arm to the Queen, Puss following quietly
after. As he stepped down the great stairway
to the royal dining room he heard some one singing
in a deep voice:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"When good King Arthur ruled this land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He was a goodly King;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He stole three pecks of barley meal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To make a bag pudding.</span><br />
<br />
"A bag pudding the King did make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And stuffed it well with plums,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And in it put great lumps of fat</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As big as my two thumbs.</span><br />
<br />
"The King and Queen did eat thereof,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And noblemen beside;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And what they could not eat that night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Queen next morning fried."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Plum pudding!" said Puss to himself. "That
sounds pretty nice," and he followed the King
and Queen into the great dining hall. Many
noblemen were present and the table was a most
gorgeous affair. Silver tankards and wonderful
gold dishes gleamed in the candlelight. Puss
was very much impressed and behaved beautifully.
And when the plum pudding came on the
table the same deep voice began to sing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"And what they could not eat that night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Queen next morning fried."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Puss," said the Queen in a whisper, "let's
finish the pudding between us! I know you'd
like some more, and so would I. Moreover,"
she added in a still lower whisper, "I don't
intend getting up early to-morrow morning to
fry what's left over&mdash;so let us finish it to-night."</p>

<p>Presently the court fool came running in, his
fool's cap all ajingle with bells. He capered
about, swinging up and down a little stick which
was also covered with tiny bells. These were
silver, and the ones in his cap were of gold, so
that the sound was very sweet.</p>

<p>The next morning Puss mounted his Good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Gray Horse and rode away, and after a while he
came to a great mound of earth in which was a
little wooden door on leather hinges.</p>

<p>"What sort of a house is this?" thought Puss.
And then, as if in answer to his question, the door
opened and there stood a big brown bear dressed
in a fur overcoat. And, oh, dear me! at first Puss
was startled, and the Good Gray Horse reared
on his hind legs. But the big brown bear didn't
growl. Not even a little bit. He just smiled
as only a brown bear can, and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If you have money<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll sell you some honey."</span><br />
</div>

<p>So Puss jumped down and followed the bear into
his hill house, for Puss was curious to see what
kind of a home this big, smiling brown bear had,
you see.</p>

<p>Well, I want you to know it was a mighty
nice sort of a place. There was a big fireplace
with great immense crackling logs, and over it,
on the mantelpiece, were two beautiful carved
candlesticks made from deers' horns, and a
cuckoo clock. And just then out came the little
cuckoo herself and began to sing.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<h2>"ONE I LOVE, TWO I LOVE"</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ONE, I love; two, I love;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three, I love, I say;</span><br />
Four, I love with all my heart;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Five, I cast away.</span><br />
Six, he loves; seven, she loves;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eight, both love.</span><br />
Nine, he comes; ten, he tarries;<br />
Eleven, he courts, and twelve, he marries.<br />
</div></div>


<p>On a big stone by the wayside sat a little boy
and girl. She held a daisy in her hand, from
which she slowly picked off the petals as she
counted:</p>

<p>"One, I love; two I love."</p>

<p>"Whoa!" cried Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"Three, I love, I say."</p>

<p>Both the children looked up. "What a
dandy cat," cried the little girl, "and what a
beautiful horse."</p>

<p>"Give us a ride?" asked the little boy.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to ride?" asked Puss,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"I can ride my rocking horse ever so fast," the
little boy replied.</p>

<p>"So can I," said the little girl.</p>

<p>"Stand on the stone," said Puss. "I'll ride
up close, and then you both can climb up behind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
me. Easy there!" cried Puss, guiding the
Good Gray Horse up to the children, who stood
close together on the big high stone. "Now
climb up behind me," and in a minute the two
children had scrambled on to the saddle. "Gid-ap!"
and off went the Good Gray Horse on a
canter.</p>

<p>"Isn't this great?" cried the little boy.</p>

<p>"Isn't it lovely?" said the little girl.</p>

<p>"One, I love; two, I love; three, I love, I
say; four, I love with all my heart," sang Puss.
"There are just four of us. You two and my
Good Gray Horse and I."</p>

<p>"But that isn't the way," said the little girl.
"You must count the petals!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so?" asked Puss. "I like my
way just the same."</p>

<p>"So do I," said the little boy. "All four of us
are pretty good chums already."</p>

<p>And the Good Gray Horse whinnied, as much
as to say: "I'm a good friend. See what I'm
doing&mdash;carrying you all so nicely on my big,
broad back?"</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Puss. "My Good Gray
Horse likes it that way."</p>

<p>"There's our house over there," cried the little
girl. "We'd better get off here."</p>

<p>"All right," and Puss helped them down.
"Good-by, good-by," and then the two children
ran up the path to tell mother all about it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>.</p>

<h2>LITTLE JENNY WREN</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
AS little Jenny Wren,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was sitting by her shed</span><br />
She waggled with her tail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She nodded with her head.</span><br />
She waggled with her tail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nodded with her head,</span><br />
As little Jennie Wren<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was sitting by her shed.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"May I put up my Good Gray Horse for the
night?" asked Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"You may, my good Sir Cat," replied the
little bird. "Hay you will find for his supper,
and straw for his bedding."</p>

<p>So Puss, Junior, jumped down and led his steed
inside the big red barn and, after tying him in
the stall, he looked around for a pitchfork.</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" asked little
Jenny Wren.</p>

<p>"A pitchfork, my dear," announced Puss.
"I must spread straw for my horse so that he
may rest comfortably, and bring in some hay
from the mow for his supper. My paws will not
do, so I must ask you where I may find the
pitchfork."</p>

<p>"Here it is, my good Sir Cat. Now let me
see you use it," answered little Jenny Wren,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
flying over to the opposite side of the shed and
lighting on the handle of a large hay fork.</p>

<p>"Now, my little Lady Wren," cried Puss,
after spreading the straw about the stall until he
had a fine bed for the horse, "show me, if you
please, the haymow, for I must give him some
hay."</p>

<p>"I will show you the oats bin, also," said the
Wren, "and here is the measure. You must lift
this little wooden slide, but see that you don't
spill the grain on the floor."</p>

<p>Lifting the slide ever so little, Puss held the
measure carefully under the wooden trough
until it was filled. Then he carried it over to
his horse, who neighed twice, as much as to say,
"Thank you."</p>

<p>"And now," said Jenny Wren, "what about
yourself, my Lord Cat?"</p>

<p>"Lord Cat!" laughed Puss. "Do lords tend
their own steeds? I fear the word Sir is even
out of place."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said little Jenny Wren, "you
have the manners of a gentleman, and that is
enough for me."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Puss.</p>

<p>"Come, follow me," cried Jenny Wren, and
she led Puss into a pretty little cottage close by.
"Hang up your cap and place your stick behind
the door, and then wash your hands in my room.
By that time I shall have supper ready for you."</p>

<h2>THE MISCHIEVOUS RAVEN</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
A FARMER went trotting upon his gray mare&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bumpety, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'humpety'">bumpety</ins>, bump!</span><br />
With his daughter behind him so rosy and fair&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lumpety, lumpety, lump!</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Can you direct me to the wise man who lives
in yonder village?" asked Puss, Junior, bowing
politely to the farmer's pretty daughter.</p>

<p>"Whoa!" cried the farmer to his gray mare.</p>

<p>"Isn't he a lovely cat?" whispered his
daughter.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked the farmer, looking
Puss, Junior, over from head to toe.</p>

<p>"I merely inquired," replied Puss, haughtily,
"if you could direct me to the wise man in
yonder town?"</p>

<p>"Whoa!" cried the farmer as the old gray
mare started off. "Whoa, there! Can't you
hear the gentleman cat addressing your master?"</p>

<p>"Whoa, Betsy," coaxed the farmer's pretty
daughter.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Cat," said the farmer, as soon as the
old mare became quiet, "we have several men in
our town who think they are wise, but some of us
farmers don't quite agree with them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, something dreadful
happened.</p>

<div class='poem'>
A raven cried croak! And they all tumbled down&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bumpety, bumpety, bump!</span><br />
The mare broke her knees, and the farmer his crown&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lumpety, lumpety, lump!</span><br />
</div>

<p>And, oh, dear me, the farmer's pretty daughter
dropped the mirror from her vanity bag, and it
broke all to smithereens and she felt so unhappy
about it that she began to cry. And then:</p>

<div class='poem'>
The mischievous raven flew laughing away&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bumpety, bumpety, bump!</span><br />
And vowed he would serve them the same the next day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lumpety, lumpety, lump!</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Botheration!" cried the farmer, rubbing the
bump on the top of his head. "That raven is
angry because I set up a scarecrow in my cornfield."</p>

<p>"Well, father," said his daughter, "our mare
can't take us to town. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"You get up behind Sir Puss and ride to
town," he replied. "I'll take the mare home.
That's the best way, I guess."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2>CANDY TOWN</h2>


<div class='cap'>PUSS, JUNIOR, helped the farmer's pretty
daughter into the saddle, and then away
went the Good Gray Horse to Candy Town.
Well, after maybe a mile and a laugh and smile,
Puss said, "I feel just like a Knight of the Round
Table, for I have rescued a maiden in distress."
And this made the farmer's pretty daughter
laugh till her cheeks grew red as two apples.</div>

<p>"Well, then, I shall call you Sir Cat," she said,
and this so pleased Puss that he began to purr at a
great rate. It was great fun, he thought. And
the farmer's daughter thought it great sport,
too, I imagine, for she began to sing a little song,
and this is the way it went:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Heigh-ho, over we go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pussy and I to town,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">What does he wish? A nice little fish,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I a silken gown.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But where is the money to buy all that,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Unless I may borrow from Sir Pussy Cat?"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Of course you may," cried Puss. "Just wait
till we get to town."</p>

<p>And then the farmer's pretty daughter blushed
very red. "I was only in fun," she said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 428px;">
<img src="images/gs16.png" width="428" height="500" alt="Puss and the farmer&#39;s pretty daughter" title="" />
</div>

<p>"But I wasn't," replied Puss.</p>

<p>"Why, have you enough money?" she asked,
giving him a hug.</p>

<p>"Don't squeeze so tight," cried Puss. "We
may have an accident, and one is enough for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to-day. I hope your father will get the old
gray mare home safely."</p>

<p>"Never fear," she replied, "father will attend
to that, all right."</p>

<p>"Here we are," said Puss, looking up at a sign-post
on which was written, "Candy Town."
"Now, where's the shop with the silken gowns?"</p>

<p>"Over there. Don't you see it right next to
the baker's shop."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," laughed Puss, "I see it now," and
he drew rein in front of the quaint little shop
and helped the farmer's daughter to alight.</p>

<p>"Come in with me," she said, "for I'd like to
buy what you like." And this so pleased Puss
that he made up his mind to buy any gown she
fancied, even if it were trimmed with diamonds.</p>

<p>"Do you want that pretty blue one?" he
asked, with a smile.</p>

<p>"How did you guess?" she answered. "You
are a wonderful cat."</p>

<p>"And now," said Puss, when the gown was
wrapped up, "let's have a cream puff in the
baker's next door, for I'm sure you're hungry."</p>

<p>"You're a wonderful guesser, Sir Puss," she
cried, "indeed you are, as well as a most generous
little cat."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BRAMBLE BUSH MAN</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THERE was a man in our town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he was wondrous wise.</span><br />
He jumped into a bramble bush<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scratched out both his eyes.</span><br />
And when he found his eyes were out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He cried with grief and pain,</span><br />
And jumped into another bush<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scratched them in again.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"That's the man I'm looking for," cried little
Puss, Junior. "I wonder where he lives. Maybe
he can tell me where to find my father."</p>

<p>"You hold your horse while I ask the baker's
wife," said the farmer's pretty daughter.</p>

<p>Pretty soon she came back and said: "He lives
in a little house just outside the town. It's not
far from our place."</p>

<p>So she and Puss rode away, and she was
mighty careful, let me tell you, not to drop the
package containing the silk gown which Puss
had given her.</p>

<p>Well, by and by they came to the wise man's
little house, surrounded by a hedge of bramble
bushes; but the wise man himself was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p>"Let's go around to the barn," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
farmer's pretty daughter. "It's milking time,
you know." And, sure enough, there they found
him.</p>

<p>"Are you the man who jumped into the
bramble bush?" asked Puss.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. But let me tell you something.
They call me a wise man, but I think a man who
jumps into a bramble bush is a silly goose."</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, the Bramble-bush
Man exclaimed: "Goodness me! I once knew a
cat who wore red-top boots. A good many
years ago there lived near here a miller who
had three sons. When he died he left all his
property to the two eldest, but to the youngest
only a cat. Well, this cat turned out to be a
most wonderful cat. Indeed, I heard that he
secured a magnificent castle for his young master,
as well as the hand of a lovely princess."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?" cried Puss, in great
excitement.</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell," replied the Bramble-bush
Man, "for I never heard where he went
after leaving here."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" sighed little Puss, Junior.
"Nobody knows where my father lives." Then
he and the farmer's pretty daughter rode away,
and in the next story you shall hear what happened
at the old farmhouse.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<h2>DAFFY-DOWN-DILLY</h2>

<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
"DAFFY-DOWN-DILLY has come to town<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">In a yellow petticoat and a green gown,"</span><br />
</div></div>


<div class='unindent'>sang the farmer's pretty daughter beneath Puss,
Junior's, window. There she stood, bending
over her flower bed, the pink strings of her
bonnet floating on the morning breeze.</div>

<p>Puss hurriedly pulled on his boots and ran
outside. "Good morning! I see your flowers
are still in bed."</p>

<p>"Daffy and Down and Dilly are very lazy, I
fear," laughed the farmer's pretty daughter;
"they'll never get to town to buy a new gown
if they don't hurry."</p>

<p>"I hope they won't meet any bad crows on
their journey," replied Puss.</p>

<p>"And I hope they won't have any bumpety
bumps!" said the farmer's pretty daughter.</p>

<p>Just then the farmer came out of the barn
leading Puss, Junior's, Good Gray Horse.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Puss. "I've had a pleasant
visit." And off he rode. By and by, after a
while, he met an old crow walking along the top
of the fence. He wore a silk hat and carried a
cane, but he couldn't lean on it, for the fence
rail was so narrow, you see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello!" said Puss, Junior. And, goodness
me! that well-dressed crow nearly lost his
balance, he was so startled at Puss, Junior's
voice.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as he had caught his breath, he
said:</p>

<p>"I have just found a beautiful pearl necklace.
Do you think it belongs to the Queen of Hearts?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/gs17.png" width="246" height="300" alt="Farmer&#39;s daughter picking flowers" title="" />
</div>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know," answered Puss.
"Suppose you come along with me and maybe
we'll find the owner."</p>

<p>So the silk-hatted old crow sat himself down
behind Puss, and the Good Gray Horse kicked
out his heels, and away they went to the next
village, and when they reached there they
stopped before the office of the Mother Goose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
daily newspaper and asked the man who ran the
"Lost and Found" advertisements if he knew
who had lost a beautiful pearl necklace of twenty-three
pearls and a little diamond clasp?</p>

<p>"Let me think," he said, scratching the top
of his head, which was as bald as a billiard ball.
You see, he was a bald-headed eagle, although I
forgot to mention it before.</p>

<p>"You might inquire at a little green house
about a mile down the road. A little yellow hen
lives there who once had a coral necklace." So
Puss said gid-ap to the Good Gray Horse and
rode away, and by and by, after a while, they
came to the little green house. And when the
old crow knocked on the door it was opened by
the little yellow hen herself.</p>

<p>"Have you lost a necklace of pearls?" he
asked, politely doffing his silk hat.</p>

<p>"Dearie me! Let me look," she answered,
hopping back into her little house. Pretty soon
she came back with a little jewel case, which
was as empty as a Christmas stocking on the
Fourth of July.</p>

<p>"Who could have taken it out?" she said.</p>

<p>So the honest old crow handed over the pearl
necklace, and went inside for a cup of tea, while
Puss said good-by and rode away.</p>

<h2>"DONKEY, DONKEY, OLD AND GRAY"</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"DONKEY, donkey, old and gray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Open your mouth and gently bray;</span><br />
Lift your ears and blow your horn<br />
To wake the world this sleepy morn,"<br />
</div></div>


<div class='unindent'>sang little Puss, Junior.</div>

<p>"I'm no rooster," replied the little donkey.
But he gave a gentle bray, just the same, and
then the Good Gray Horse neighed, and after that
a little adder crawled out of a hole in the ground
and said:</p>

<p>"Gracious me! What's all this noise?" And
that only goes to show what a dreadful din it
must have been, for adders are deaf, so they tell
me.</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, Puss didn't wait any longer,
but rode away, and by and by, after a while, he
met a funny little man with a sack over his back.</p>

<p>"What have you in your bag?" asked Puss,
for he felt sorry for the little old man and meant
to give him a lift in case he had a heavy load,
you see.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" asked the little old
man, with a scowl. And before you could say
"Jack Robinson!" he disappeared inside a stump.</p>

<p>Puss jumped off his Good Gray Horse and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
peeped in. But he couldn't see anything, only
a big black hole. Well, he was just going to turn
away when he heard a voice say:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Mother, I've brought you a bag of gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the little pink-and-white pig I sold."</span><br />
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/gs18.png" width="299" height="350" alt="The Donkey" title="" />
</div>

<p>So Puss peeped in again, and pretty soon he
saw a tiny light way down deep, like the flicker
of a candle. And by and by, as his eyes grew
used to the darkness, he saw a flight of stairs.
Then what do you think he did? Jump into the
hollow stump and climb down? That's just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
what he did, and it wasn't long before he found
himself in a little hall opposite a small door with
a glass knob inside of which was an electric
light, which I suppose had been put there by the
little old man in case he got home after twelve
at night and his wife had blown out the candle.</p>

<p>All of a sudden the door opened and a little old
woman, bent and withered, asked, in a shrill
voice:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"How dare you come down to our Hollow Stump hall?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll cut off your whiskers, tail and all."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Please, ma'am," said little Puss, Junior,
"I won't tell anybody." And I guess he would
have climbed up the stairs then and there if he
hadn't feared she might cut off his tail when he
turned around.</p>

<p>"Let him go, mother," said the little old man.
"He would have given me a ride on his horse on
my way home had we met sooner." But how
he knew that is more than I can tell. "Here,
Sir Cat. Take this gold piece and tell neither
man nor beast where you got it." And he
pushed Puss up the little flight of stairs.</p>

<h2>"TICK, TACK, TOO"</h2>


<div class='cap'>ONE day Puss, Junior's, Good Gray Horse
lost a shoe.</div>

<p>"Gracious me! I must find a smithy," said
Puss, Junior, anxiously. Luckily there was a
small village near by, and pretty soon he drew
rein in front of a blacksmith shop. But, oh,
dear me! there was no one there except a small
boy.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Jack Jingle went 'prentice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make a horseshoe;</span><br />
He wasted the iron<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till it would not do.</span><br />
<br />
His master came in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And began for to rail.</span><br />
Said Jack, "The shoe's spoiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But 'twill still make a nail."</span><br />
<br />
He tried at the nail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, chancing to miss,</span><br />
Said, "If it won't make a nail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It shall yet make a hiss."</span><br />
<br />
Then into the water<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Threw the hot iron, smack,</span><br />
"Hiss!" quoth the iron.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I thought so," said Jack.</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"You good for nothing!" cried the blacksmith,
coming into the shop, "here's a customer at hand
and you have no shoe for his horse."</p>

<p>"How long will it take to make one?" asked
Puss, Junior.</p>

<p>"All day and maybe longer," said the smith&mdash;"that
is, if you depend on that clumsy lad."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/gs19.png" width="229" height="300" alt="Checking the horse&#39;s shoe" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, I don't want to depend on him," said
Puss, with a grin; "neither do I want to take
chances with my good horse."</p>

<p>"Neither shall you, my Lord Cat," replied
the smith. "I will see that your horse is well
shod, for he is indeed a fine beast."</p>

<p>"He has good legs, has he not?" asked Puss,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
running his paw down the foreleg of the big
gray horse, like a professional horseman.</p>

<p>"He has that," said the blacksmith, "and a
fine head, too."</p>

<p>"He's a good roadster," added Puss, seating
himself on a three-legged stool while the smith
lifted the horse's leg and held it between his
knees.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has good feet," said the smith,
"and he shall have a fine shoe."</p>

<div class='center'>
Here a nail, and there a nail, tick, tack, too.<br />
</div>

<p>As soon as the shoe was on, Puss, Junior,
mounted and rode away. But before he left he
turned to Jack and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tick, tack, too; learn to make a shoe!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Some day you may turn out ten</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If you don't get blue."</span><br />

<h2>LULLABY BABY</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
MATTHEW, Mark, Luke, and John,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bless the bed I lie upon.</span><br />
Four corners to my bed,<br />
Five angels there lie spread;<br />
Two at my head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two at my feet,</span><br />
One at my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My soul to keep.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>Puss, Junior, looked in at the window. On a
little white bed lay a pretty child.</p>

<p>"Now go to sleep, my little one," softly whispered
his mother. "Snuggle down and find a
little dream&mdash;a little dream about woolly lambs
and white daisies."</p>

<p>Then she tiptoed from the room, and no sound
was heard except her footsteps on the stairs.
Just as she looked through the open door she saw
Puss slide down the post that held up the roof
of the porch.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, madam," he explained, politely.
"I climbed up to see if anyone were at home.
Nobody answered the doorbell. But when I saw
your little boy I kept very, very still so as not to
disturb him."</p>

<p>"You are a good cat," she answered, with a
sigh of relief. "I'm glad you were quiet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am very tired, madam," said Puss, "for
I have journeyed far to-day. Would it be
asking too much if I might sleep on your front
porch?"</p>

<p>"You may sleep on a big red cushion in the
hall," she replied, "and I will also give you a bowl
of milk."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/gs20.png" width="257" height="300" alt="Puss asleep" title="" />
</div>

<p>"May I put my Good Gray Horse in your
barn?"</p>

<p>"Of course," she answered. "You will find
plenty of hay and oats for his supper."</p>

<p>The Good Gray Horse followed his small master
to the stable and was soon made comfortable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
for the night. Then Puss locked the stable door
and brought the key into the house.</p>

<p>"Hang it up on the nail behind the door,"
said the mother of the little child. "And take
off your boots. They make so much noise on
the kitchen floor. I fear they will keep my
little one awake."</p>

<p>"I will gladly take them off," said Puss, and
he placed them behind the door underneath the
big barn key.</p>

<p>"My husband will be home very soon," she
said, "but if you are very tired I will give you
your supper at once."</p>

<p>"I would like it now," said Puss, with a weary
sigh. And when he had finished he jumped upon
the big red cushion and was soon fast asleep.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIRE</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
MY Lady Wind, my Lady Wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went round about the house to find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A chink to get her foot in;</span><br />
She tried the keyhole in the door,<br />
She tried the crevice in the floor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drove the chimney soot in.</span><br />
<br />
And then one night when it was dark<br />
She blew up such a tiny spark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all the house was pothered;</span><br />
From it she raised up such a flame<br />
As flamed away to Belting Lane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And White Cross folks were smothered.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>Puss, Junior, awoke with a start to find his
room filled with smoke. And, oh, dear me!
when he opened his door red flames were already
crawling up the woodwork.</p>

<p>Running up the stairs two at a time, he
pounded on the nursery door and shouted, "Fire!
fire!" And then, of course, the baby awoke
with a cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Puss, Junior, what shall I do?" cried the
mother, for the cruel flames were now creeping
across the hall.</p>

<p>"Don't open the door," he cried. "The hall
is a mass of flames. Climb through the window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to the roof of the porch. Be quick!" and he
jumped through the little hall window and ran
across the roof to the nursery. "Come out
here!" he shouted. "Be quick, or the flames
will be in your room before you can get out."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/gs21.png" width="233" height="300" alt="Pussing warning of the fire" title="" />
</div>

<p>Just then, all of a sudden, a ladder was placed
against the porch, and a kind fireman with a big
red helmet on his head held out his arms. "Give
me the baby and follow me." Puss held the top
of the ladder to steady it until they were safe
on the ground and then slid down without touching
the rungs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our pretty house will be burned," sobbed
the baby's mother.</p>

<p>"And my red-top boots," cried Puss.</p>

<p>"There goes the stable!" shouted the fireman.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" cried Puss. "I'd better get
my Good Gray Horse!"</p>

<p>By this time the hose was connected and soon
the engine was pumping water on the flames.
But, oh, dear me! it was too late. The pretty
little house quickly burned to the ground&mdash;only
the big red chimney was left. It was hard work
to save the stable, but at last the flames were put
out.</p>

<p>"We all must sleep in the hay loft," said Puss.</p>

<p>So the Good Gray Horse was led back into his
stall. He was the only one who was comfortable
that night, I guess.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE OLD WOMAN'S RIDDLE</h2>


<div class='cap'>"OH, dear me!" sighed little Puss, Junior,
as he thought of his lovely red-top boots
which had been destroyed by the fire. "Where
shall I get another pair?" for he knew that no
ordinary bootmaker had the skill to make boots
for a cat. However, when he mounted his Good
Gray Horse he found, to his surprise, a couple
of gold sovereigns in his pocket. "That's something
to be thankful for," he laughed, as he set
out upon his journey through Old Mother Goose
Land. "I'll stop at the first cobbler shop and
see what I can buy."</div>

<p>As he rode gayly along he came across a funny
little old woman. On her head was a red sunbonnet
and over her shoulders a bright-green
shawl. Black-lace mits covered her thin hands,
and a pair of white slippers her two little feet.</p>

<p>"My good woman," said Puss, Junior, politely
raising his cap as he drew in his Good Gray
Horse, "can you tell me where I may find a
shoemaker?"</p>

<p>The old woman smiled and said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"What shoemaker makes shoes without leather,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With all the four elements put together?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fire and water, earth and air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And every customer wears a pair."</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Puss.</p>

<p>"Why, a blacksmith, you goosey!" cried the
little old woman, tossing her head.</p>

<p>"I don't want shoes for my Good Gray Horse,"
said Puss, in a disgusted tone of voice. "I want
a pair of shoes for myself."</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed the little old woman.
"So my fine Sir Cat would have a pair of shoes?"</p>

<p>"No, my good woman&mdash;a pair of <i>boots!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, then," she replied, "keep on your way
until you reach yonder village. Then cross the
bridge and you will soon come to a bootmaker.
He will, no doubt, be able to fit a pair of boots
to Your Royal Highness's feet." Then she turned
up a lane and left Puss to continue his way alone.</p>

<p>"Ah, me!" sighed Puss. "I don't feel a bit
like myself without my red-topped boots. Indeed,
I feel like an imposter. How will anyone
believe that I am Puss in Boots, Junior, if I have
no boots?" And, for the first time in his life,
he felt discouraged. He had met with many
disappointments on his journey through Mother
Goose country, but to be without boots seemed
almost too hard to bear. Still, with a brave
heart, he rode on toward the village. "I have at
least the money with which to buy them," he
said, "and this is much to be thankful for."
Which was a wise saying, I think, for a cat who
had been out in the world for so short a time as
had little Puss, Junior.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE COBBLER</h2>


<div class='cap'>"CAN you make me a pair of boots?" asked
Puss, Junior, reining in his Good Gray
Horse.</div>

<p>The cobbler, who was sitting close to the open
window of his little shop, looked up from his
bench.</p>

<p>"Will you need two pair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One pair, my good man," replied Puss,
Junior, haughtily. "Do you imagine I wear
boots on my front paws?"</p>

<p>"Well, my good Sir Cat," answered the cobbler,
"I did not know for certain. I can make
two pair as well as one."</p>

<p>"And charge for two pair, I warrant, also,"
cried Puss, with a grin.</p>

<p>"I can give you fine work," said the cobbler.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked Puss. "My last pair,
which was unfortunately burned up in a fire,
was made by a royal cobbler."</p>

<p>"I have not made boots for royalty," replied
the cobbler, "but I made the shoe in which an
old woman lives with so many children that it
would take you an hour to count them all. That
was some job, let me tell you. One doesn't often
live in a shoe, although one may walk in one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me you made that
wonderful shoe?" cried Puss.</p>

<p>"Most certainly, my good Sir Cat."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/gs22.png" width="313" height="400" alt="The Cobbler" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Then you shall make me a pair of boots.
And, mind you, my good man, they must have
red tops."</p>

<p>"That they shall," said the cobbler. "Dismount,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and come into my humble shop. I would
measure your feet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have a pair on hand that will
fit me," said Puss, gazing about the tiny shop.</p>

<p>"I will see," replied the cobbler.</p>

<p>"I am in haste," said Puss, as the cobbler
looked over his stock. "I am in haste, for I
have yet a long journey before me, and cannot
delay. I am in search of my illustrious father,
Puss in Boots."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the cobbler. "I once made a
pair of boots for a cat. Could it have been the
noble Puss in Boots?"</p>

<p>"Tell me where he lives," cried Puss, much
excited.</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the cobbler, "that I do not
know, for it is many years ago since I made the
boots. But here is a pair I think will fit you."</p>

<p>"I would rather that you had told me where my
father lives," said little Puss, Junior, "than to
have found a pair of boots."</p>

<p>"They are certainly a fine fit," said the
cobbler, gazing with admiration at Puss, Junior's,
feet.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Puss, "and here is the money.
Good-by," and off rode our little hero, still in
search of his father, the famous Puss in Boots.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<h2>DOCTOR DRAKE</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
DOCTOR DRAKE kept a shop,<br />
Of dimensions not large,<br />
In a hole in the haystack<br />
By the side of the yard,<br />
Where he dispensed certain small stones<br />
And one or two gravels,<br />
With sundry rare herbs<br />
He had found in his travels.<br />
</div></div>


<p>"I hope the good doctor's at home," said Puss,
as he reined in his Good Gray Horse. "I don't
feel at all well to-day."</p>

<p>So he dismounted and knocked on the front
door, and pretty soon the famous duck doctor
appeared. He wore a big pair of spectacles and
a very high collar, around which was tied a green
cravat which matched the feathers of his tail.</p>

<p>"Quack, quack!" said Doctor Drake. "What
do you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Doctor," answered Puss,
Junior. "I feel far from well; in fact, I think
I'm going to be very ill."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," replied Doctor Drake; "that's
what we doctors are looking for&mdash;sick people. I
can cure you, never fear."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Puss, Junior.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/gs23.png" width="373" height="475" alt="Dr. Drake checking Puss" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Don't thank me yet," answered Doctor
Drake; "wait till you're cured&mdash;then pay me."</p>

<p>"That will I gladly do," replied Puss, Junior;
"only make me feel like myself again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think," said Doctor Drake, after looking at
Puss, Junior's, tongue, "you had better give up
horseback riding; it's bad for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed poor Puss, Junior. "What
shall I do with my Good Gray Horse?"</p>

<p>"Sell him to me," replied Doctor Drake.
"I'm in need of a horse. My practice is growing
so large I find it difficult to make my calls."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you do," said Puss. "Your
feet are not for walking, but for swimming."</p>

<p>"Right you are," assented the doctor. "Of
course, some of my patients live in the pond;
but, then, again, a lot of them don't. Take these
pills." And the famous duck doctor handed
Puss, Junior, a little round box. "One every
hour; they'll soon fix you up, all right. Now,
how much do you want for your horse?"</p>

<p>Puss, Junior, scratched his head. "What will
you give?" he asked, tearfully.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five pounds," replied the doctor.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Puss. "The horse is yours.
Give me my money and I will journey along on
foot, though it goes hard with me to part with
my faithful steed." Then, tucking the box of
pills in his pocket, Puss proceeded on his journey.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<h2>"NO BIGGER THAN MY THUMB"</h2>


<div class='cap'>HAVING traveled so long on horseback, Puss,
Junior, found it hard to resume his journey
on foot. However, he manfully set out once
more. The pills Doctor Drake had given him
made him feel quite frisky, and he ran along at a
good rate. In fact, he felt that perhaps he might
just as well have kept his Good Gray Horse and
taken the chance of becoming really ill. But
it was too late now; the bargain had been made
and he must make the best of it. So on he
jogged, whistling a merry tune to help along his
tired feet.</div>

<p>By and by he came to a pretty cottage and,
entering the front gate, looked in through the
window. At a table sat a woman, singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I had a little husband, no bigger than my thumb;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I put him in a pint pot, and there I bid him drum.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I bought a little horse that galloped up and down;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I saddled him and bridled him and sent him out of town.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I gave him some garters to garter up his hose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And a little pocket handkerchief to wipe his pretty nose."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I wish she had given me the little horse," said
Puss, with a sigh, "for I certainly miss my good
gray steed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the woman looked up and, seeing
Puss at the window, called out, "Come in, little
Sir Cat."</p>

<p>Puss, Junior, jumped nimbly through the open
window and stood beside her.</p>

<p>"What do you think of my little husband?"</p>

<p>"He certainly is no bigger than your thumb,
madam."</p>

<p>"He is a good little man, all the same," she
replied, "and when he's astride of his little horse
he makes a fine appearance. Wait, and I will
show you how well he can ride."</p>

<p>All of a sudden Puss heard the pawing of
hoofs, and there stood the prettiest little horse
he had ever seen. It was no larger than a play
toy, but well built. A long, silky mane fell over
his neck, and a curly tail almost reached to the
ground. Then, quick as a wink, the little husband
jumped out of the pint pot and vaulted
nimbly into the saddle.</p>

<p>"Gid-ap," he cried, and away went the little
horse down the road.</p>

<p>"Good-by, madam," cried Puss, running after
the tiny horseman. But it was impossible to
catch up with him, and pretty soon he disappeared
in a cloud of dust. "Well, well," cried
Puss to himself, "I had no idea that such a tiny
steed could run so fast. Will wonders never
cease until I have found my dear father, Puss in
Boots?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, taking out his pocket handkerchief, he
wiped his forehead. "I shall not despair, however,"
he said, bravely, "for I have a good pair
of legs, and all journeys come to an end at last,
so I shall keep merrily on my way."</p>

<h2>TELL-TALE-TIT</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
TELL-TALE-TIT!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your tongue shall be slit,</span><br />
And all the dogs in the town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall have a little bit.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>Oh, dear me! This is what was going to happen
to the little girl who had told on her brothers.
And all the little dogs were standing around,
wagging their tails, as Puss, Junior, passed by.</p>

<p>It was a wonder that the dogs didn't rush out
and bark at him, but they were so anxious to get
a piece of the little girl's tongue that they didn't
notice him at all. Perhaps a cat with boots and
spurs, a hat and plume, and a trusty sword
didn't look like an ordinary cat to them. And
neither was our little traveler.</p>

<p>You see, these little boys had gone into an
alley to play marbles, on their way to school, and
then the little girl had told her father how they
had missed their lessons.</p>

<p>"And Jimmy Jones won all the marbles, and
there was a fight! And the teacher kept them in
after school!"</p>

<p>"Oh me! oh my!" cried Puss, Junior. "Please
don't slit her tongue!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why did you tell tales on your brothers?"
asked her father.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't slit her tongue!" cried
Puss, Junior, again.</p>

<p>"That's what they did in <i>Mother Goose</i>."</p>

<p>"It must have been very long ago in the dark
ages," answered Puss, laying hold of his sword.</p>

<p>"Well, it's only a rhyme!" laughed her father,
picking up his little girl and hugging her. "Come
on, Sir Cat, follow me. You are quite a Knight
of the Round Table. If a fair lady be in distress
you are her champion!"</p>

<p>Pretty soon all three came to a little house
and Puss was invited to come in and play.
There was a nice swing under an old apple tree,
and soon he was swinging as high as the little girl
could push him. All of a sudden he jumped
out up among the branches and hung on to a
limb, just like a trapeze performer.</p>

<p>"I once was with a circus," he explained,
sliding down the rope and turning a somersault
on the ground.</p>

<p>Just then the little boys came in the gate and
how they did laugh! And Jimmy gave Puss all
the marbles which he had won, and his father,
who had been sitting on the porch watching the
fun, gave Puss a dollar. After that they all
went in for lunch and Puss didn't start out on his
journey until late in the afternoon.</p>

<h2>ON THE WAY</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"ON the way, on the way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To see my father, old and gray.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Faster still, my good gray steed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Over hill and flowering mead.</span><br />
<br />
"Faster, faster, Good Gray Horse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hasten swiftly on your course,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till I see the stately towers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where my father spends his hours."</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Urge me not too much!" panted the faithful
steed. "I'm doing my best, but these hills have
made me short of breath."</p>

<p>Dear me! I forgot to tell you that the Good
Gray Horse had run away from the famous Doctor
Drake and had caught up to Puss, Junior, just
as I commenced this story.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," cried little Puss, Junior. "In
my anxiety to see my father I have been selfish."
And he slipped a lump of sugar into the mouth
of the Good Gray Horse.</p>

<p>Well, after several miles had gone by, Puss
drew rein at a drinking trough beside the road,
where his faithful steed drank long and deep.
And as they rested a while, who should fly by but
a busy bumblebee, buzzing from flower to flower.</p>

<p>He was a jolly-looking bee, and presently he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
said to Puss, "Whither are you bound, my good
Sir Cat?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/gs24.png" width="372" height="475" alt="Riding to the castle" title="" />
</div>

<p>"To the castle of my Lord of Carabas," replied
our little traveler. "I'm seeking my
father, who is seneschal to my lord."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, is that so?" exclaimed the bee. "These
are stirring times. I heard only last week that
my Lord of Carabas was going to war!"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed our small hero, jumping to
his feet and clapping his paw to his sword. "I
must hurry on!"</p>

<p>"Bravely spoken," answered the bee. "I
have seen many soldiers at the castle of late.
Indeed, the country is all excitement&mdash;flags
flying, drums beating, men drilling, women
scraping lint. All is bustle and hustle."</p>

<p>"And what brings you so far from there?"
inquired Puss, replacing his sword in his scabbard.</p>

<p>"My two good wings," replied the bumblebee,
and he laughed as he dove head first into a
flower after its dewy sweetness.</p>

<p>"Come, little master," cried the Good Gray
Horse. "I am rested. Let us hasten on our
journey."</p>

<p>Puss bade good-by to the golden bumblebee
and sprang once more into the saddle. And the
Good Gray Horse threw out his heels and galloped
off toward the castle of my Lord of Carabas,
but evening came upon them and they
were still far from their destination, so Puss dismounted
for the night beneath a grove of trees.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<h2>LITTLE BOY BLUE</h2>


<div class='cap'>YOU remember in the last story that Puss
and his Good Gray Horse had camped in a
grove of trees for the night. Well, just as Puss
was about to curl up and take a little trip to
dreamland he heard a voice singing:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Little Boy Blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Come, leave your toys.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It's time to wash hands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For little boys.</span><br />
<br />
"Supper is ready,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">You must not wait.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tuck in your napkin</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And don't tip your plate.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, where is Boy Blue?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Let's all take a peep.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He's there on the sofa,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Fast asleep."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Puss opened his eyes and saw a little light
twinkling through the trees. So he got up and
went toward it to find that it shone from the
window of a small cottage. As he knocked on
the door he thought, "I may be asked to spend the
night, and that will be much more comfortable
than lying beneath the trees." And it turned out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
just as he thought. The pretty woman who
opened the door asked him in, saying, softly:</p>

<p>"Tiptoe in, my dear Puss, Junior, for Boy
Blue has just gone to sleep." And you know
how softly a cat can tiptoe! But of course he
first slipped off his red-topped boots with their
clanking spurs.</p>

<p>Then Boy Blue's mother gave Puss, Junior,
some milk and cake, and after that he put his
Good Gray Horse in the stable and came back
to sit down by the fire.</p>

<p>Over the mantelpiece hung a silver horn, and
as Puss looked up at it he remembered long ago
in Old Mother Goose Land a little Boy Blue
who blew his horn to call the cows from the
fields of corn.</p>

<p>"Does your little Boy Blue go to sleep in a
haystack?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear," laughingly replied his mother,
"but his father did. And that's the horn he
used to blow in the early morn to call the cows
and the woolly sheep when under the haystack
he'd fallen asleep."</p>

<p>"I met him once, a long time ago," said little
Puss, Junior. "I remember the place quite well.
He carried me on his shoulder over to see little
Miss Muffet who sat on a tuffet, and she gave
us some curds and whey till a horrid old
spider sat down beside us and frightened her
away."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so you were the little cat who was with
him, were you?" said little Boy Blue's mother.</p>

<p>But Puss didn't answer, for he had fallen fast
asleep and was dreaming that he was once more
with his dear father, the famous Puss in Boots.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<h2>ALPHABET TOWN</h2>


<div class='cap'>NOW let me see. Where did I leave off in
the last story? Oh yes, I remember now.
Little Puss, Junior, had fallen asleep in the house
where little Boy Blue lived. Yes, Puss had
fallen asleep in front of the fireplace over which
hung the silver horn that called the cows from the
fields of corn. Well, the next morning the horn
began blowing all by itself, and this, of course,
woke up everybody in the house; so Puss washed
his face and hands and curled his whiskers and
after that he pulled on his red-topped boots and
was ready for breakfast. Then Mrs. Boy Blue
came downstairs with little Boy Blue. He was
only three years old, but he could blow a horn,
though I don't think the cows paid much attention
to him, for they knew he was only doing it in
fun, you see.</div>

<p>Well, after breakfast, Puss, Junior, bade them
all good-by and mounted his Good Gray Horse,
and by and by, after he had ridden many a mile,
he came to a very queer place&mdash;it was called
Alphabet Town. But the strangest thing of all
was that the alphabet was alive. Yes, from
A to Z it was alive, and Puss was so interested
that he drew rein at the gates of Alphabet Town
because, he said to himself, "If I expect to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
through Mother Goose Land I must learn the
alphabet, and the sooner I learn it the sooner I
shall see my dear father." So he went up to the
schoolhouse and this is what he learned:</p>

<div class='poem'>
A was an Ant who worked all the day.<br />
B was a Butterfly, flitting away.<br />
C was a Cherry that hung on a tree.<br />
D was a Daisy that grew on the lea.<br />
E was an Elm that stood by the school.<br />
F was a Frog that lived in a pool<br />
G was a Goat with a beard on his face.<br />
H was a Horse that won a fine race.<br />
I was an Insect that fed on a peach.<br />
J was a Jay Bird whose song was a screech.<br />
K was a Kitten that played with a string.<br />
L was a Lambkin that browsed in the spring.<br />
M was a Magpie that stole a gold spoon.<br />
N was the Nest where she slept 'neath the moon.<br />
O was the Oak Tree that held safe the nest.<br />
P was a Pigeon with soft purple vest.<br />
Q was a Quail that was shot with a gun.<br />
R was a Rooster that woke up the sun.<br />
S was a Snail that was awfully slow.<br />
T was a Turtle, no faster, you know.<br />
U was a Unicorn; of him you have heard.<br />
V was a Vulture, a rapacious bird.<br />
W was a Wren that made a sweet noise.<br />
X was a Xmas Tree, covered with toys.<br />
Y was a Yule Log, dragged through the snow.<br />
Z was a Zero when winter winds blow.<br />
</div>

<p>And I think when I tell you that Puss learned
this alphabet in less than half an hour you will
agree with me he was a very bright cat.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<h2>LUCY LOCKET</h2>


<div class='cap'>"GID-AP!" said Puss, Junior. "Gid-ap, my
good steed, for we must hasten on. 'Tis
yet a long ways we must journey ere I find my
illustrious father, Puss in Boots."</div>

<p>The Good Gray Horse quickened his pace,
and soon many a mile was left behind.</p>

<p>At length Puss saw a little girl in the doorway
of a cottage.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Lucy Locket<br />
Lost her pocket;<br />
Kitty Fisher<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Found it;</span><br />
Nothing in it,<br />
Nothing in it,<br />
But the binding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round it.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Whoa!" cried Puss. "Can I help you, miss?"</p>

<p>"I'm so disappointed!" cried the little girl.
"I thought there might be a bright penny inside."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there isn't?" asked Puss,
sympathetically. "Do you want a penny very
much?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the child.</p>

<p>"Well, here's one," replied Puss, thrusting his
paw into his pocket and bringing out a bright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
penny. Leaning down from his horse, he handed
it to the little maid.</p>

<p>"What are you going to buy with it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Peppermint stick," she answered. "Peppermint
stick with red rings all around it."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/gs25.png" width="320" height="375" alt="Puss and the Little Maid" title="" />
</div>

<p>"That sounds pretty nice," said Puss.
"Where's the candy shop?"</p>

<p>"Just over there," she replied, pointing to a
small shop on the opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>"Let's go in," suggested Puss, dismounting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and tying his Good Gray Horse to the hitching
post.</p>

<p>The candy shop smelled very nice. Molasses
candy in long yellow coils lay in the glass cases.
Sticks of pink-and-white peppermint candy stood
in big glass bowls with shiny glass stoppers.
Chocolate drops were ranged in long glass dishes.
There were gumdrops and marshmallows, and
goodness knows what all. Puss thrust his paw
deep into his pocket, for he knew that one little
penny wouldn't go very far in this candy shop.</p>

<p>"What other kind do you like?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why don't you call me Kitty?" laughed the
little maid. "My name is Kitty Fisher."</p>

<p>Just then another little girl appeared.</p>

<p>"Hello, Lucy Locket!" cried Kitty.</p>

<p>"I've just lost my pocket," said Lucy. "Did
you happen to find it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Kitty, "but there was nothing
in it. Just a ribbon round it."</p>

<p>"That's 'cause I took out my penny," answered
Lucy, "and I'm going to spend it right here
before I lose it."</p>

<p>Soon both little girls had eaten their peppermint-candy
sticks. And after Puss had given his
Good Gray Horse a big lump of sugar he mounted
and rode away.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<h2>TOM, THE PIPER'S SON</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
"TOM was a piper's son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He learned to play when he was young;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But all the tune that he could play</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Was 'Over the hills and far away.'"</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"Well, it's a pretty fine tune," said Puss,
Junior, to himself, as the strains from Tom's pipe
came clear and sweet across the meadow. "I
wish I could play as well." Again the music
came down the breeze, clear and sweet, and
pretty soon Tom came capering toward him,
followed by a crowd of boys and girls.</p>

<p>"Heigh-ho!" laughed Puss. "Here they come,
dancing away, as if they had nothing to do but
play all the day long."</p>

<p>"Over the hills and far away!" piped Tom.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" cried Puss.</p>

<p>"Come and dance," said the piper's son, taking
the pipe from his mouth; "come and have
a merry dance. Make those red-topped booties
prance."</p>

<p>"Then play a merry jig," answered Puss,
catching up a small pig and waltzing him around
at a giddy rate.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried the pig. "I'm getting
dizzy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't let you fall," replied Puss, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Let go!" squeaked the pig. "I tell you I'm
getting dizzy!"</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you say 'let go' at first,"
laughed Puss. "You said, 'hold on.'"</p>

<p>By this time the poor pig was so out of breath
that he rolled over on his side and lay quite still
until a small boy said:</p>

<p>"Your tail is all twisted from dancing around
and around."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied the pig, sitting up.
"Pigs' tails are always twisted. Dancing makes
your head go around, but it doesn't curl your
tail."</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden Tom commenced to play
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't!" cried the breathless pig.
"I don't want to dance any more."</p>

<div class='poem'>
Tom with his pipe did play with such skill<br />
That those who heard him could never stand still;<br />
Whenever they heard him they began to dance&mdash;<br />
Even pigs on their hind legs would after him prance.<br />
</div>

<p>And, goodness me! it was such wonderful
music that even Puss couldn't keep still, but
must needs dance with a little girl in a blue dress
until Tom was out of breath and too tired to play
any longer.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<h2>OLD DAME TROT</h2>


<div class='cap'>AS soon as Tom, the piper's son, stopped playing
everybody sat down to rest, even the
little pig who had been waltzing about on his
hind legs. He didn't try to run away. I guess
he was too tired for that. Pretty soon he took
out a yellow handkerchief and wiped the perspiration
from his pink nose, and after that
the little girl in blue asked Puss, Junior, where
he had learned to dance.</div>

<p>"At Mademoiselle Feline's dancing school,"
replied Puss. "She taught twenty-one little
kittens twice a week."</p>

<p>Just then, all of a sudden, Tom, the piper's
son, jumped to his feet and started off, and
before very long</p>

<div class='poem'>
He met Old Dame Trot with a basket of eggs;<br />
He used his pipe and she used her legs;<br />
She danced about till the eggs were all broke;<br />
She began to fret, but he laughed at the joke.<br />
</div>

<p>"I think it very mean of you to break an old
lady's eggs," cried Puss.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry your eggs are broken," cried Tom
to Old Dame Trot. "If you'll come with me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I'll show you where there's a nest full of eggs;
it's in the dry grass under the raspberry bushes
in yonder meadow."</p>

<p>But the old lady had gone only a few steps
when</p>

<div class='poem'>
Tom saw a cross fellow beating an ass<br />
Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;<br />
He took out his pipe and played them a tune,<br />
And the jackass's load was lightened full soon.<br />
</div>

<p>"It serves that fellow right," cried Puss.
"His donkey had too heavy a load."</p>

<p>And while the tin pans were flying about and
clattering on the stones the old lady climbed
over the fence.</p>

<p>"There goes the hen to her nest now!"
shouted the children.</p>

<p>"I'll play her a tune and while she's dancing
you pick up the eggs and give them to Old
Dame Trot," cried Tom.</p>

<p>Of course as soon as the music commenced the
little hen began to dance. And when all the
eggs were in the old lady's basket he stopped
playing, but the little hen was so provoked that
she went straight home to the barnyard.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<h2>BOBBY SHAFTO</h2>


<div class='cap'>AS Puss, Junior, rode along on his Good Gray
Horse he passed a pretty cottage near the
roadway. And the roses that climbed over the
front porch were so fragrant and the voice of
the girl floating through the open window was
so sweet that he stopped to listen.</div>

<div class='poem'><br />
"Bobby Shafto roams the skies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With silver goggles on his eyes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A lonely girl am I who sighs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For pretty Bobby Shafto.</span><br />
<br />
"Bobby Shafto's bright and fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Very gay and debonair;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He's the king of all the air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bonny Bobby Shafto.</span><br />
<br />
"His airship is the fastest one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That races with the golden sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And when his azure voyage is done,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pretty Bobby Shafto.</span><br />
<br />
"He's promised he will marry me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And then how happy I shall be;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We two shall sail the starry sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I and Bobby Shafto!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 430px;">
<img src="images/gs26.png" width="430" height="475" alt="Singer sharing cream" title="" />
</div>

<p>Pretty soon the owner of the lovely voice
looked out of the window and when she saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Puss she asked him to come in and sit on the
front porch while she went for some cream.
So Puss tied his Good Gray Horse to the hitching
post and, opening the little gate, sat down on
the doorsteps. After he had finished drinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the cream she asked him to tell her where he was
going with his lovely red-topped boots and long
feather plume. And would he take out his
sword and show it to her? All this made him
very proud, and of course he thought she was a
lovely little girl.</p>

<p>Well, after a while they spied an airship in
the sky. Pretty soon it came nearer and nearer
till finally it landed in a field close by. The
little girl and Puss jumped up and ran as fast
as they could across the road and through the
fence.</p>

<p>Throwing her arms around Bobby Shafto, she
cried, "He's the king of all the air."</p>

<p>Then he took off his silver goggles and shook
hands with Puss, and soon they all came back
to the little cottage and had ice cream and
sponge cake, and Bobby Shafto fed the Good
Gray Horse a quart of oats, and after that Puss
said good-by and rode away.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<h2>LITTLE ROBIN REDBREAST</h2>


<div class='cap'>"WELL, well!" said Puss to himself as he
left Bobby Shafto and the little girl.
"To think I should see an airship in Mother
Goose country!"</div>

<p>By and by he heard a little bird singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Up went pussy cat, and down went he;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Down came pussy cat, away robin ran;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Said Little Robin Redbreast, 'Catch me if you can!'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little Robin Redbreast jumped upon a wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pussy cat jumped after him, and almost got a fall;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Little Robin chirped and sang, and what did pussy say?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pussy cat said, 'Mew,' and Robin flew away."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"What are you trying to do?" asked Puss,
Junior, stopping under the tree and looking up
at the pussy cat.</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to do anything," replied the
pussy cat, crossly. "I was wishing I had wings."</p>

<p>"They'd be very convenient at times," said
Puss, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Indeed they would," answered the pussy cat.
"I'd rather have them than red-topped boots."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," answered Puss. "But I have
found my boots most helpful. Do you know,"
he continued, "if people would be a little more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
contented with what they have I think they'd
get more."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/gs27.png" width="410" height="475" alt="Cat climbing a tree" title="" />
</div>

<p>The pussy cat looked ashamed of herself.
"What you say is very true. I suppose I

claws. It's not hard work climbing trees, and
as for running, my legs carry me very well.
Perhaps I don't need wings, after all."</p>

<p>"Well, I never saw a flying cat," admitted
Puss, Junior, "although I've seen some remarkable
things since I started out to find my
father, Puss in Boots."</p>

<p>"So you are a traveler," said the pussy cat,
jumping down from the wall and walking up to
Puss. "How long have you been looking for
your father?"</p>

<p>"A long, long time," replied Puss, Junior.
"Do you know, sometimes I almost get discouraged,
for this is a big world and at times I
feel so very, very small."</p>

<p>"Well, you come home with me," said the
pussy cat. "You need a good rest. I think
you're tired out."</p>

<h2>THE ELF CHILD</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
LITTLE Miss Pussy Cat had a house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was very trim and neat.</span><br />
But, oh, dear me! there wasn't a mouse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For little Miss Pussy to eat.</span><br />
</div></div>


<p>"There's a nice, soft cushion on the window
seat," she said to Puss, Junior. "Why don't
you take a nap?"</p>

<p>And as he was very tired with his long journey,
he curled up and was soon fast asleep. But, oh,
dear me! all of a sudden there came a loud knocking
on the door, and when Miss Pussy opened it
there stood a little dog with a very loud bark.
And then, of course, Puss woke up with a start.</p>

<p>"Please make him go away," said Miss Pussy
Cat. "I'm dreadfully afraid of dogs."</p>

<p>So Puss picked up his big stick and the little
dog ran away as fast as he could, never again to
bother little Miss Pussy Cat. And shall I tell
you why? It was because when he finally
stopped running he found himself in the woods
where the fairies lived.</p>

<p>And when they saw him they said to one
another, "This little dog has been up to mischief,
for if not, why should he run so fast?" And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
then the king of the fairies said, "I will see that
he makes no further mischief," and he waved
his silver wand, and the little dog turned into a
dogwood flower that blooms every year in the
same spot under the great shady trees.</p>

<p>Of course little Miss Pussy wondered for a
long time why she never saw him, until, one day,
Jennie Wren, who lived in the woods, told her
what the fairies had done.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon Puss, Junior, set out once
more to find his father, and as he went along he
whistled a tune to keep up his spirits, when, all
of a sudden, he heard a little low whistle. And
there in the road, a few feet ahead, was a tiny
little man dressed in green with a high-peaked
hat on his head.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I've never heard a whistling cat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So come to the wood with me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And whistle a tune to my elfin child</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Under the greenwood tree."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Then little Puss, Junior, followed the queer
little dwarf and by and by, after a while, they
came to a glen in the wood where, under a great
oak tree, sat the prettiest little elf you ever saw.
He was playing with a gray squirrel and a striped
chipmunk, but when he saw Puss he gave a glad
shout and away went the squirrel and the chipmunk.
But he didn't care, for a cat with boots
was something he had never seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Teach him to whistle, Sir Cat," said the
dwarf.</p>

<p>So Puss sat down by the elf child and by and
by, just as the stars began to twinkle from the
sky, he had taught him to whistle. And, would
you believe it? it sounded like a bird, it was so
sweet and clear. And after that Puss went on
his way to find his father, happy to think that
he had proved so good a music master.</p>

<p>And some day, in another book, I will tell you
how little Puss, Junior, finds his dear father.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS SERIES</h2>

<h3>By LILLIAN ELIZABETH ROY</h3>


<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<div class='center'>
<b>Handsomely Bound. Colored Wrappers. Illustrated.</b><br />
<b>For Children 6 to 12 Years</b><br />
</div>

<div class='center'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</div>

<p>This series presents early American history in a manner
that impresses the young readers. Because of George and
Martha Washington Parke, two young descendants of the
famous General Washington, these stories follow exactly
the life of the great American, by means of playing they
act the life of the Washingtons, both in battles and in
society.</p>

<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Their thrilling battles and expeditions generally end in "punishment"
lessons read by Mrs. Parke from the "Life of Washington." The culprits
listen intently, for this reading generally gives them new ideas for further
games of Indian warfare and Colonists' battles.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS RELATIVES</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Davis children visit the Parke home and join zealously in the games
of playing General Washington. So zealously, in fact, that little Jim
almost loses his scalp.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' TRAVELS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The children wage a fierce battle upon the roof of a hotel in New York
City. Then, visiting the Davis home in Philadelphia, the patriotic Washingtons
vanquish the Hessians on a battle-field in the empty lot back of
the Davis property.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS AT SCHOOL</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After the school-house battle the Washingtons discover a band of gypsies
camping near the back road to their homes and incidentally they secure
the stolen horse which the gypsies had taken from the "butter and egg
farmer" of the Parkes.</p></div>


<div class='unindent'><br />THE LITTLE WASHINGTONS' HOLIDAYS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They spend a pleasant summer on two adjoining farms in Vermont.
During the voyage they try to capture a "frigate" but little Jim is caught
and about to be punished by the Captain when his confederates hasten in
and save him.</p></div>
